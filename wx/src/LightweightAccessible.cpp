//=========================================================================
//  LightweightElement Accessibility Support
//=========================================================================
//  We want to support screen-readers and other devices for blind and
//  vision-impaired users.  We do this using wxWidgets' wxAccessible class,
//  which is in turn based on Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA) version
//  1.3.  Unfortunately, MSAA provides a fragile and poorly-documented way
//  of talking to screen readers.  Even more unfortunately, there's nothing
//  else that's any better, short of directly working with the screen
//  reader companies and building a custom interface.
//
//  MSAA is a little bit like QuickTime, in that both are black arts.  In
//  neither case can we really rely on the official documentation, and the
//  ultimate test of a given approach is whether it works (and continues to
//  work) in practice.
//
//  Some good news: We're not the first people to go down this path.  In
//  particular, the Mozilla team has been here before, and they took very
//  good notes on what actually works.  Read this before continuing:
//
//    http://www.mozilla.org/access/windows/msaa-server
//
//  Among other things, this document explains which portions of the MSAA
//  API to implement, which portions MUST be ignored to prevent crashes,
//  and how everything actually fits together.  Since Mozilla is one of the
//  largest and best-documented users of MSAA, we'll have the best luck if
//  we follow its conventions (and those of IE, on which the Mozilla MSAA
//  support is apparently based).
//
//  Next, read these:
//
//    http://www.wxwidgets.org/manuals/2.6.3/wx_wxaccessible.html
//    http://www.wxwidgets.org/docs/access.htm (may be slightly out of date)
//
//  For comparison purposes, here's how Adobe has implemented accessibility:
//
//    http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/
//
//  In general, supporting MSAA isn't enough to make screen readers work.
//  You must also instruct the screen reader to use MSAA support for certain
//  windows on the screen.
//
//  For quick & dirty debugging, I'm especially fond of Microsoft's
//  AccExplorer and related tools.  For serious work, you'll need a screen
//  reader license.
