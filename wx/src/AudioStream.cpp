//=========================================================================
//  AudioStream Methods
//=========================================================================
//  AudioStream has tricky thread-safety issues.  In particular, there
//  are *three* threads of execution involved:
//
//    1) The main application thread.
//    2) The FillBuffer() interrupt task.
//    3) The background Idle() thread.
//
//  Most of our public interface takes place in thread (1).  Thread (2) is
//  managed internally by PortAudio, and calls FillBuffer between calls to
//  Start() and Stop().  Thread (3) is directly managed by AudioStream, and
//  calls Idle() from after the first call to InitializationDone() until
//  some undetermined time during Delete().
//
//  We have two critical sections:
//    
//    - sCriticalSection: For the mStreamState, mIsRunning and sStreams
//      variables.  We never hold this critical section for more than an
//      instant; doing so can block the main application thread.
//    - sPortAudioCriticalSection: For all PortAudio API calls.  We're too
//      lazy to figure out whether PortAudio is thread safe.  If you need
//      to hold sPortAudioCriticalSection *and* sCriticalSection, then
//      acquire sPortAudioCriticalSection *second* to prevent deadlocks.
//      During stream deletion, it may be necessary to hold this lock for
//      a while, because some of the PortAudio API functions take a while
//      to compelete.
//
//  We also have two wxConditions (with associated wxMutexes).  These
//  live in AudioStreamThread:
//
//    - mSleepCondition: This is used to wake the background thread
//      up from its normal TIMER_INTERVAL naps, when we have something
//      we want it to handle immediately.  We don't maintain strict
//      synchronization on this condition; it's just an optimization.
//    - sUnregisterCondition: The background thread signals this condition
//      when it has finished unregistering a stream and the foreground
//      thread can wake up and delete the stream object.
//
//  We use sCriticalSection, mSleepCondition and sUnregisterCondition to
//  synchronize between (1) and (3).  We haven't tried using any wxWidgets
//  functions to synchronize with (2), and we don't know if they'd
//  work--instead, we rely on carefully-designed circular buffers in our
//  subclass VorbisAudioStream.
//
//  Now go have a a look at AudioStreamThread, InitializationDone, Preload,
//  Delete, RegisterStream, UnregisterStream and IdleAllStreams.
