3.3.13 - 15 July 2002 - zeb, emk

  * Language change: (IF cond true_cmd false_cmd) now takes arbitrary
    expressions for 'cond'.  The following new primitives have
    been added: AND, OR, NOT, contains, =, <>, <, >, <=, >=.
  * Added a new (LOG filename msg) command, which allows the programmer
    to write to "5L", "debug" and "MissingMedia" logs.
  * Major logging improvements: All primitives are now automatically
    logged in a standard format (bug #1003).
  * Adjusting of coordinates using origin is now logged.
  * Callbacks are now logged in a much more useful fashion.
  * Old arithmetic primitives now return a value (add, sub, div).
  * Added MakeQuotedString to TTemplateUtils and wrote a matching test suite.
