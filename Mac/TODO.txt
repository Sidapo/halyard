In CPlayerView.h:383, we changed:

	if (picName == nil)
		mBackPic = nil;

...to:

	if (picName == "")
		mBackPic = nil;

We also changed many initializers to use "" instead of nil.  What do these changes
affect?  Let's test them.

Can we still compile a copy of 5L for 68K, and see whether we broke TaskUPP or
sTaskUPP in CTimerTask.cp?
