Build Instructions for Mac5L

Prerequisites:
- CodeWarrior Pro 5.3
- The latest Universal headers from Apple 
	These are needed for a more recent interface to QuickTime than the 
	interfaces that ship with Metrowerks.
- CVS 
	I use MacCVS (http://www.cyclic.com/). The interface isn't perfect but
	it seems to work pretty well.
	
	
1. Check out the latest source code from CVS.
	A. The CVSROOT that I use is:
		:pserver:chuck@imlcvs.dartmouth.edu:/usr/local/cvsroot
		You will need your own account on imlcvs (see Benton or Mark).
	B. Check out the "iml" project.
		I check it out to the "Work" drive.
2. Open Mac5L.mcp.
	This is the Codewarrior project file for the engine. You will find it
		in "iml:FiveL:Dev:Mac:FiveL:Mac5L.mcp"
3. Build it.
	A. Release version: Select the "PPC Release" target.
	B. Debug version: Select the "PPC Debug" target.
	C. To do a clean build first remove all objects by selecting:
		Project:Remove Object Code... 
	D. Build it by selecting:
		Project:Make
4. Debug it.
	A. Build the debug version.
	B. The Mac5L.config file in Output:PPC_Debug is the one the engine
		will read to find the project to debug. What I do is keep several
		version of this file for the different projects I want to debug
		and only name one Mac5L.config. The others I put some prefix on
		so that I can use them later.
	C. Set breakpoints in the code and start the debugger:
		Project:Enable Debugger (if it has been disabled)
		Project:Run
