FiveL for Macintosh Release Notes

2.00, Build 3, Thursday, October 21, 1999 10:38:34 AM

¥ The problem with the white background in the release engine has been fixed.

¥ The debug engine will ignore fade commands. This was making it impossible to
debug certain parts of the engine. (It is hard to debug when faded out)

¥ The debug engine will no longer send signals when it encounters an exception. 
It was doing this when it couldn't find a file, etc. Signals would cause a 
Type 12 error when a debugger wasn't present.

¥ The release engine will maintain a log file for interesting messages. This
file is called "Log" and will be created in the same directory as the engine.
The creator and type of this file match Simple Text.

¥ The release engine will no longer put up alerts for missing media, it will
just write an entry to its log file.
