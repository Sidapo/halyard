    Send equals? fix to author of Swindle

/   Move many functions from TValue.h to TValue.cpp
/   Remove 'inline' from conversion operators
/   Redesign TArgumentList (for primitives)
/   Redesign TCallbackArgumentList
/   Test TValue extensively with real TCallbacks
/   Test TValueToScheme extensively with real TCallbacks
/   Remove all #include <TValue.h>
/   Remove all #include <GraphicsTools.h> 
/   TArgumentList conversion problems
/     bool
/     double
/     int/uint mess
/   Fix TCallbackPtr TArgumentList::GetCallbackArg() to use a member function
/   TVariableManager API duplication
    Cleanup
/     Move TPolygon & TValueList operator<< to .cpp files
/     Rename TValueManager to TVariableManager, including file names
/     Merge TVariableTests into TVariableManager.cpp
/     Delete TVariable.*
/     Fix CommonHeaders to not have nasty hack
    Simplifications AFTER commit
/     Delete SET, and fix SETTYPED to use TValues
/     Clean up SETTYPED interface in kernel.ss
/     Replace big switch statements in TSchemeInterpreter.cpp with *Conv
/     Let callers of TValueManager call only "Set" and "Get"
/     LogParameter can now rely on ostringstream and operator<<
/     Delete FindVariable and Assign (you'll need to fix the callers)
/     Stop automatically initializing variables to "0"--throw errors instead
/     Delete TBTree code?
/     Delete TArray?
/     Delete TObject?
/     Get rid of TYPE_UNINITIALIZED
/     Fewer SetPrimitiveResult* functions?  Definitely.
/     Fix up TRect so that it takes x-y values, and not y-x values.
/     Get rid of TString.

  Cleanup
    Make sure GUI does REFERENCE_TEST_CASE_FILE
    Replace all old-style test cases with new-style test cases
    Remove TestCase.h inclusions from random cpp files
    Comment new macros in TestCase.h

  Node/event model
    (on cleanup ...)
    Is (on setup-finished () ...) called at the right time?
    Is UPDATE-UI the right event name?  We don't have wxWindows semantics.
    Allow elements to be attached to sequences
    Enable and disable zones in engine (for cursor purposes only?)
    PROP-CHANGE API needs work
    Do we want to systematize DRAW-BUTTON method for all zones?
    Areas in need of major refactoring
      Can we combine node-handlers and node-values?
      Deletion of elements is a mess.  Fix.
      NODE-HAS-EXPENSIVE-HANDLERS? is currently a bit tricky
      Can we combine @ and node-values?
      Look for other syntactic patterns
    Open questions
      Hierarchial property value searching -- is it what we want?
    Add EVENT-KEYS method to wrap EVENT-CHARACTER and EVENT-MODIFIERS
    Respond gracefully to errors in idle handlers
    ON should highlight method name in emacs

  Quake 2
    Notify level when somebody looks at something

  Audio layer
    Bugs
      Fix stutter when switching from sine to vorbis clip (portaudio bug?)

    Useful features
      Geiger counters
        Mix pre-recorded loops with random synth
        Hook into Tamale for Geigers
        Hook into Quake for Geigers
      Hook into Quake for ambients
      Stereo panning
      Kill off Quake sound effects when leaving sim card group

    Less Important (Or Even Dubious)
      We're clipping the last 0.1 seconds or so (actually, I think
        portaudio is), and we should fix this
,     Try to get complete code coverage testing Vorbis playback path

  Make TException stop reporting line numbers

  Rename 'foo::ptr' in TestCase to better represent smart-pointer nature?

Older Stuff
-----------

  Object store
    Implement data types

Notes
-----

  To build Linux wxWindows, configure as:

    $ CC=gcc-3.0 CXX=g++-3.0 ./configure --disable-shared
