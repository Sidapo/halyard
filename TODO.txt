  Patches
    Send equals? fix to author of Swindle
    Handle large mass of wxWindows patches
    Look for other patches to send back upstream

  wxWindows mess
    Extract existing patches and send to wxWindows patch tracker
    Discuss design issues in wx-devel mailing list

  Postponed after demo
    Make Stage::GetEventDispatcher return shared pointer
    Change error-handling system for binmsg?
    Reticle bugs

      Fix bug where reticle is too large when part of object behind player
    Fix audio problems when in background
      Premature restart of loops
      Stuttering during disk access

  Cleanup
    Update cursor every time an element cursor changes
    Make sure %kernel-run-callback returns result of callback
    Allow TValue test cases to be run independently of TSchemeInterpreterTests
    Make sure GUI does REFERENCE_TEST_CASE_FILE
    Replace all old-style test cases with new-style test cases
    Remove TestCase.h inclusions from random cpp files
    Comment new macros in TestCase.h
    Add interface for getting modifiers+char as list from char events

  Node/event model
/   (on exit ...)
    Is (on setup-finished () ...) called at the right time?
    Is UPDATE-UI the right event name?  We don't have wxWindows semantics.
    Enable and disable zones in engine (for cursor purposes only?)
    PROP-CHANGE API needs work
    We may need to fully virtualize property getters and setters
    Do we want to systematize DRAW-BUTTON method for all zones?
    Areas in need of major refactoring
      Can we combine node-handlers and node-values?
      Deletion of elements is a mess.  Fix.
      NODE-HAS-EXPENSIVE-HANDLERS? is currently a bit tricky
      Can we combine @ and node-values?
      Look for other syntactic patterns
    Open questions
      Hierarchial property value searching -- is it what we want?
    Add EVENT-KEYS method to wrap EVENT-CHARACTER and EVENT-MODIFIERS
    Respond gracefully to errors in idle handlers

  Quake 2
    Notify level when somebody looks at something

  Audio layer
    Bugs
      Fix stutter when switching from sine to vorbis clip (portaudio bug?)

    Useful features
      Geiger counters
        Mix pre-recorded loops with random synth
        Hook into Tamale for Geigers
        Hook into Quake for Geigers
      Hook into Quake for ambients
      Stereo panning
      Kill off Quake sound effects when leaving sim card group

    Less Important (Or Even Dubious)
      We're clipping the last 0.1 seconds or so (actually, I think
        portaudio is), and we should fix this
,     Try to get complete code coverage testing Vorbis playback path

  Make TException stop reporting line numbers

  Rename 'foo::ptr' in TestCase to better represent smart-pointer nature?

Notes
-----

  To build Linux wxWindows, configure as:

    $ CC=gcc-3.0 CXX=g++-3.0 ./configure --disable-shared
