  Patches
    Send equals? fix to author of Swindle

  TStateDB
/   Implement TStateDB
,   Make a single TStateDB readable and writable from Scheme
/     (set-state-db-datum! "/foo" value) ;; Defined in tamale.ss?
/     Allow listener to be an (on state-db-changed (get) ...) handler
/       (call-5l-prim 'StateDbGet (node-full-name ELEM) key)
X     Allow listener to be a simple lambda?  Maybe too hard?
X       (state-db-register-listener! '/foo
X                                    (lambda (get) (whatever (get '/foo))))
/   Implement a new graphic element which listens to three keys:
/     .../x - x coordinate of element
/     .../y - y coordinate of element
/     .../index - Index of graphic to display

  March Demo
    Fix audio problems when in background
      Premature restart of loops
      Stuttering during disk access
    Reticule/look support
      Figure out what the player is looking at
/       Get Quake 2 working in 5Ltest_wx again, with non-VTR AI
?       Figure out where to hook in look check code--probably post-movement
        Send a simple text message to the client
        Send an explicit "look" message to the client
      Displaying reticules (hack video support)
      Activate reticules (acts as trigger)
      Looking at reticulates (acts as trigger)
      Looking at entities (acts as trigger)
    Trigger Quake 2 targets from Scheme
    Reimplement meters in Scheme
      Allow elements to be attached to sequences

      CDV 715

  Cleanup
    Allow TValue test cases to be run independently of TSchemeInterpreterTests
    Make sure GUI does REFERENCE_TEST_CASE_FILE
    Replace all old-style test cases with new-style test cases
    Remove TestCase.h inclusions from random cpp files
    Comment new macros in TestCase.h
    Add interface for getting modifiers+char as list from char events

  Node/event model
/   (on exit ...)
    Is (on setup-finished () ...) called at the right time?
    Is UPDATE-UI the right event name?  We don't have wxWindows semantics.
    Enable and disable zones in engine (for cursor purposes only?)
    PROP-CHANGE API needs work
    We may need to fully virtualize property getters and setters
    Do we want to systematize DRAW-BUTTON method for all zones?
    Areas in need of major refactoring
      Can we combine node-handlers and node-values?
      Deletion of elements is a mess.  Fix.
      NODE-HAS-EXPENSIVE-HANDLERS? is currently a bit tricky
      Can we combine @ and node-values?
      Look for other syntactic patterns
    Open questions
      Hierarchial property value searching -- is it what we want?
    Add EVENT-KEYS method to wrap EVENT-CHARACTER and EVENT-MODIFIERS
    Respond gracefully to errors in idle handlers

  Quake 2
    Notify level when somebody looks at something

  Audio layer
    Bugs
      Fix stutter when switching from sine to vorbis clip (portaudio bug?)

    Useful features
      Geiger counters
        Mix pre-recorded loops with random synth
        Hook into Tamale for Geigers
        Hook into Quake for Geigers
      Hook into Quake for ambients
      Stereo panning
      Kill off Quake sound effects when leaving sim card group

    Less Important (Or Even Dubious)
      We're clipping the last 0.1 seconds or so (actually, I think
        portaudio is), and we should fix this
,     Try to get complete code coverage testing Vorbis playback path

  Make TException stop reporting line numbers

  Rename 'foo::ptr' in TestCase to better represent smart-pointer nature?

Notes
-----

  To build Linux wxWindows, configure as:

    $ CC=gcc-3.0 CXX=g++-3.0 ./configure --disable-shared
