  VTRA fixes
    set-zone-cursor! -> set-element-cursor!
    0-opaque alpha -> 255-opaque alpha
    All (rect ...) objects exclude their right and bottom edges
  Overlays
/   Use opacity to hit-test overlays
/   Enhance rectangle merging code
/   Fix engine to use 255-opaque alpha instead of 0-opaque alpha
    (@ ...) -> @...
    Drag-and-drop demo
/ Cleanups
/   SetZoneCursor -> SetElementCursor
/   Don't allow idle with non-default DC
/   Allow fetching of bounds rect for current DC
/   Allow fetching of color for current DC
/   Make sure textaa layer uses right-/bottom-exclusive rects

  Audio layer
    Bugs
      Fix stutter when switching from sine to vorbis clip (portaudio bug?)

    Useful features
      Geiger counters
        Mix pre-recorded loops with random synth
        Hook into Tamale for Geigers
        Hook into Quake for Geigers
      Hook into Quake for ambients
      Stereo panning
      Kill off Quake sound effects when leaving sim card group

    Less Important (Or Even Dubious)
      We're clipping the last 0.1 seconds or so (actually, I think
        portaudio is), and we should fix this
,     Try to get complete code coverage testing Vorbis playback path

  Make TException stop reporting line numbers
  Rename LOAD-PICTURE to DRAW-something.
  Add EVENT-KEYS method to wrap EVENT-CHARACTER and EVENT-MODIFIERS
  Respond gracefully to errors in idle handlers
  ON should highlight method name in emacs

  Rename 'foo::ptr' in TestCase to better represent smart-pointer nature?
  

/ Event Handling
/   Nice features
/     Returning values from event handlers?
/     Send idle events to everything

    Areas in need of major refactoring
      Can we combine node-handlers and node-values?
      Deletion of elements is a mess.  Fix.
      NODE-HAS-EXPENSIVE-HANDLERS? is currently a bit tricky
      Can we combine @ and node-values?
/     Use FOREACH in kernel
      Look for other syntactic patterns
    Open questions
      Hierarchial property value searching -- is it what we want?
      SET-PROP! -- Is it what we want?  Probably good to avoid for now.

Long Term
---------

    Implement high-speed wxBitmap access
    Text extensively on different systems

  Stabilization
    Look for other known bugs, prioritize, and fix
    Testing

  Big Stuff
    Section 508
    Field-customizability
    SCORM and/or mainstream LMS software
    Content security
    GUI editing tools for content authors, graphic artists

Notes
-----

  To build Linux wxWindows, configure as:

    $ CC=gcc-3.0 CXX=g++-3.0 ./configure --disable-shared
