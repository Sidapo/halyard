;;  Kernel and Script Loader
;;=========================================================================
;;  This code loads our runtime kernel and our user scripts.  Both the
;;  kernel and the user scripts are loaded into an isolated namespace,
;;  which we can throw away and recreate in a pristine condition whenever
;;  a developer asks us to reload the currently running script.
;;
;;  You can find similar code for the DrScheme IDE in tool.ss.
