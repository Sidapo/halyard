    ;; ORDERED? is a property of a static node, thus it needs to be 
    ;; implemented as a class-level attribute.
    ;; 
    ;; The ORDERED? attribute needs to be special in two ways.
    ;;
    ;; 1) We need to be able to override ORDERED? in subclasses and
    ;;    when defining the node using GROUP.  Class-level attributes
    ;;    aren't normally overridable though, since they don't follow
    ;;    the initialization protocol.  Since it also doesn't need to
    ;;    ever be written, instead of actually declaring it as an
    ;;    attribute, we just define an overridable getter, and
    ;;    override it on any level of the hierarchy that we need to.
    ;;
    ;; 2) We would like to be able to override the value when
    ;;    declaring a node using the keyword arguments on GROUP.
    ;;    Normally, this sets up attr-initializers on the class, which
    ;;    handle how instances of the class are set up, but we
    ;;    override .ATTR-INITIALIZER to instead define a getter method
    ;;    on the class (aka static node) with the appropriate value.
    ;;
    ;;    This also leads to the somewhat strange consequence that the
    ;;    way you override the value of ORDERED? in a subclass is by
    ;;    using (default ordered? ...) in the class body itself, not
    ;;    a (with-instance (.class) ...), even though this is effectively
    ;;    a class-level attribute.
    ;;
    ;; Note that using VALUE for ORDERED? will keep subclasses from 
    ;; overriding it by sealing the getter method.  This basically 
    ;; corresponds to the way VALUE works for regular attributes, 
    ;; to reduce surprise.
