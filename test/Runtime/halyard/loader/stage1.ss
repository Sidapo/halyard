;;=========================================================================
;;  Kernel and Script Loader
;;=========================================================================
;;  This code loads our runtime kernel and our user scripts.  Both the
;;  kernel and the user scripts are loaded into an isolated sandbox, which
;;  we can throw away and recreate in a pristine condition whenever a
;;  developer asks us to reload the currently running script.
;;
;;  THREAD WARNING - See lang/scheme/MZSCHEME-THREADS.txt for details.
;;
;;  Whenever we call *sandboxed-evaluator*, it actually switches us into a
;;  new thread.  This is dangerous, because it involves doing non-portable
;;  things behind the back of our C++ compiler.  Specifically, everything
;;  between our call to scheme_set_stack_base and the current stack frame
;;  is actually _moved_ temporarily to another address in memory!
;;
;;  Whenever we call from C++ to Scheme, it's vitally important that we do
;;  so from the correct thread.  Specifically, if we call a function in
;;  this file, we need to do it from our original C++ thread (the one
;;  running TInterpreterManager).  If we call a function in kernel.ss, we
;;  must do so from *sandboxed-evaluator*'s thread.
;;
;;  The two important transfers of control happen in load-script and
;;  run-script, below.  When these functions call *sandboxed-evaluator*,
;;  they switch into *sandboxed-evaluator*'s thread, run some code, and
;;  switch back into the original thread once that code is finished.  Once
;;  in *sandboxed-evaluator*'s thread, Scheme will call back out into C++,
;;  which will in turn call back into Scheme, all from the correct thread.

     ;; helper is pulled into our sandbox, #%engine-primitives will come
     ;; with it.
