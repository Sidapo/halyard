  ;;              efficiently busy-wait at the top-level.
  ;;    STOPPED:  The kernel has been stopped.
  ;;    PAUSED:   The interpreter should pause the current card until it is
  ;;              told to wake back up.  This is used for modal text
  ;;              entry fields, (wait ...), and similar things.

  ;;    CARD-KILLED: The interpreter should stop executing the current
  ;;               card, and return to the top-level loop.
