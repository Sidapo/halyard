;;  Bootstrap Environment
;;=========================================================================
;;  An almost-entirely-empty environment which contains just enough
;;  declarations to declare more modules.  We use this to help initialize
;;  both the 5L engine's Scheme environments, and those created by our
;;  DrScheme IDE plugin.
