  STATIC-NODE or NODE-CLASS?
    Make names distinct globally
  Replace ASSERT with %ASSERT as needed 

  Better error message if we call SUPER with no SUPER
  Take care of TODO items

  Get test cases for SET! SLOT from ruby-nodes.ss
  Why did we go into an infinite loop when accessing .RUNNING before it was
    initialized?  Probably a recursive print error; it may be fixed now.
