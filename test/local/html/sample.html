    <h1>In-Engine HTML Text</h1>

    <p>This is actual <strong>HTML</strong> text, loaded off the local hard
    drive.  It can be displayed using either Internet Explorer or the
    wxHtmlWindow widget (a basic-but-solid cross-platform widget normally
    used for online help).</p>

    <h2>Advantages</h2>

    <p>Some advantages of this widget include:</p>

    <ul>

     <li>User stay in Tamale, improving immersion (and keeping them from
     getting confused about how to return to the program when they finish
     browsing).</li>

     <li>If we use wxHtmlWindow, the browser can't fail because of IE or
     Netscape problems.</li>

     <li>We have control over which URLs the user visits, and we can
     log the specific sites (and times) in the user's logfile.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Sample Pages</h2>

    <p>Here are a few sample pages to examine.  To return from one of
    these pages, press Control-R (for "Reload Script").  With a bit more
    work, we could actually have a <strong>Back</strong> button and other
    standard widgets.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="sample2.html">Another sample page</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="http://iml.dartmouth.edu/">IML's web site</a> (too
      complex to display correctly in the simple browser).</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.nowhere.org/">Can't go here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
