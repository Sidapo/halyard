;; PORTED
;; Some very minimal test cards for the updater.  It can do quite a bit
;; more, but unfortunately, much of the necessary example code for the
;; fancier features is tied into various boring in-house libraries,
;; graphics, etc.
;;
;; Also, these cards are very old, and should not be used as an example of
;; good coding style.
