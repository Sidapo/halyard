;;  Tamale Demo and Test Script
;;=========================================================================
;;  The goal of this script is to demonstrate good Tamale coding style,
;;  show how all of Tamale's features are used, and provide a way for
;;  Tamale programmers to test whether a given feature is working.
;;
;;  Tamale is still very much in flux, and we won't freeze any APIs until
;;  version 1.0 is released.  And quite frankly, we *do* need to clean up
;;  a bunch of stuff before it's ready for use by the general public.
;;  We apologize for any temporary inconveniences.
