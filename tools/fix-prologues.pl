# Fix license boilerplate and Emacs modelines in the specified files,
# making backups.  On DOS, you may need to set PERLIO=crlf before running
# this script.
#
# When updating the licenses (usually when updating the year), we should
# probably run this script on the following files:
# 
#   tools/find-halyard-sources | PERLIO=lf xargs tools/fix-prologues.pl
#
# The following files should be excluded:
#
#   git checkout Common/test/scripts    # Can't have prologues here.
#   git checkout runtime/templates      # Public domain
