We are pleased to announce Halyard version ${vernum}.

Halyard is a scriptable multimedia engine, with support for video,
audio, graphics, and user interaction. It currently runs on Windows,
and has a preliminary Macintosh port. Halyard is based on PLT Scheme,
wxWidgets and the Quake 2 Engine. It includes a rudimentary IDE based
on Scintilla.
