 Revision 1.4  2002/08/16 16:26:38  emk
 3.5.0 - 16 Aug 2002 - emk, zeb

 Preliminary Scheme support for Windows.  The Macintosh build is broken
 until Brian updates the event loop to use a TInterpreterManager object
 and figures out how to get the mzscheme libraries building.

 Ported 3.4.1 changes forward to Windows.

 Revision 1.3.2.1  2002/08/14 22:30:10  emk
 3.4.1 - Bugfix: Commands with bodies now check for the "returning" flag
 correctly, even if they're within macros (Macro has its own return system
 which works slightly differently from Card's).

 Revision 1.3  2002/06/20 16:32:55  emk
 Merged the 'FiveL_3_3_4_refactor_lang_1' branch back into the trunk.  This
 branch contained the following enhancements:

   * Most of the communication between the interpreter and the
     engine now goes through the interfaces defined in
     TInterpreter.h and TPrimitive.h.  Among other things, this
     refactoring makes will make it easier to (1) change the interpreter
     from 5L to Scheme and (2) add portable primitives that work
     the same on both platforms.
   * A new system for handling callbacks.

 I also slipped in the following, unrelated enhancements:

   * MacOS X fixes.  Classic Mac5L once again runs under OS X, and
     there is a new, not-yet-ready-for-prime-time Carbonized build.
   * Bug fixes from the "Fix for 3.4" list.

 Revision 1.2.6.1  2002/06/06 05:47:30  emk
 3.3.4.1 - Began refactoring the Win5L interpreter to live behind an
 abstract interface.

   * Strictly limited the files which include Card.h and Macro.h.
   * Added TWin5LInterpreter class.
   * Made as much code as possible use the TInterpreter interface.
   * Fixed a few miscellaneous build warnings.

 Revision 1.2  2002/05/15 11:05:33  emk
 3.3.3 - Merged in changes from FiveL_3_3_2_emk_typography_merge branch.
 Synopsis: The Common code is now up to 20Kloc, anti-aliased typography
 is available, and several subsystems have been refactored.  For more
 detailed descriptions, see the CVS branch.

 The merged Mac code hasn't been built yet; I'll take care of that next.

 Revision 1.1.4.1  2002/04/30 07:57:31  emk
 3.3.2.5 - Port Win32 code to use the 20Kloc of Common code that now
 exists.  The (defstyle ...) command should work, but (textaa ...) isn't
 available yet.

 Next up: Implement the (textaa ...) command and the low-level
 GraphicsTools::Image::DrawBitMap.

 Revision 1.1  2001/09/24 15:11:01  tvw
