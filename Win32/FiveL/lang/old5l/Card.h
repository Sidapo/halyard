 Revision 1.4.2.1  2002/08/14 20:24:50  emk
 Language bugfixes/enhancements/changes for HIV Prevention Counseling.  I
 removed some deeply-buried bugs in TStream and elsewhere, so please test
 this build thoroughly.

   * New entities: &shy;, &nbsp;, and &radic;.  I've also added
     &check; and &cross;, but we don't have the necessary font support yet.
   * TStream now handles whitespace rationally.  String literals are
     parsed verbatim, and the old "randomly munge whitespace" behavior
     has been fixed.  Most of the other changes are necessary consequences
     of this change.
   * Verbatim CR, LF and TAB characters in strings will be passed through.
     This may affect screen layout.
   * The (get ...) primitive has been backported from 3.5.
   * The '&' syntax has been removed.  Instead of '&foo$bar', you should
     now write '$(get foo$bar)'.
   * Entities don't need to be escaped any more: \&amp; -> &amp;.

 Thanks to this cleanup, it was possible to implement several much-wanted
 features without too much work:

   * New primitives: WHEN, UNLESS and WHILE.
   * BODY has been renamed to BEGIN, and longer prematurely evaluates all
     the variables in nested expressions.
   * Debug log improvements.

 Revision 1.4  2002/06/20 16:32:54  emk
 Merged the 'FiveL_3_3_4_refactor_lang_1' branch back into the trunk.  This
 branch contained the following enhancements:

   * Most of the communication between the interpreter and the
     engine now goes through the interfaces defined in
     TInterpreter.h and TPrimitive.h.  Among other things, this
     refactoring makes will make it easier to (1) change the interpreter
     from 5L to Scheme and (2) add portable primitives that work
     the same on both platforms.
   * A new system for handling callbacks.

 I also slipped in the following, unrelated enhancements:

   * MacOS X fixes.  Classic Mac5L once again runs under OS X, and
     there is a new, not-yet-ready-for-prime-time Carbonized build.
   * Bug fixes from the "Fix for 3.4" list.

 Revision 1.3.6.3  2002/06/12 19:03:03  emk
 3.3.4.5 - Moved Do* commands from Card.{h,cpp} to TWinPrimitives.{h,cpp},
 and broke the remaining dependencies between these primitive commands and
 the current 5L interpreter.  The TInterpreter and TPrimitives interfaces
 are now quite mature.

 *** Please beat very, very hard on this build.  I don't anticipate
 further changes to the Windows engine for a while. ***

 REMOVED COMMANDS: kill (use still), loadpick (use loadpic)
 NEEDS TESTING: origin w/macros, other uses of origin.  5L now
   sets the origin to 0,0 whenever it begins a new card, which
   should produce behavior identical to the old system, unless
   I've overlooked something.
 NEEDS TESTING: make sure all the commands are available, and
   have the right names.  I've checked this a dozen times
   by eye, but I might have overlooked something.

 The only remaining dependencies between the interpreter and the rest of 5L
 are in the Header and TStyleSheet classes.  I'm postponing this last bit
 of cleanup until after 3.4.  Up next: Repeat the 3.3.4.{1-5} changes for
 the Macintosh.

 Revision 1.3.6.2  2002/06/11 18:15:43  emk
 3.3.4.4 - Partial separation of primitives from interpreter, and
 various 5L language enhancements related to callbacks.

   - Finished fleshing out TArgumentList, added support for callbacks.
   - Made all built-in primitives access their arguments through the
     TArgument interface.
   - Implemented a BODY command.
   - Changed how the TOUCH, BUTTPCX and KEYBIND commands parse their
     callback arguments.  See below for details; you'll have to change
     some code.  This was necessary to move callback parsing into
     TStream's implementation of the TArgumentList interface.

 5L Language Changes
 -------------------

   * (KEYBIND ...) now takes an arbitrary command instead of a card name.
     As with TOUCH and BUTTPCX, variables are evaluated when the
     keybind is installed, not when it is invoked.  Examples:

       (keybind f (jump foo))
       (keybind a (add x 10))

   * You can now run a series of zero or more commands using (BODY cmd...).
     This should work with IF, TOUCH, BUTTPCX and KEYBIND.  Example:

       (body
         (set x 10)
         (set y 20))

     Commands such as WAIT, JUMP, NAP, etc., will not do what you expect
     unless they're the last statement in a BODY.  This is caused by the
     low-level design of the interpreter, and is non-trivial to fix.

     RETURN is also not BODY-friendly.

     When you pass a body to IF, TOUCH, BUTTPCX or KEYBIND, all the
     variables in the body will be evaluated *before* any code is run!

   * The arguments to BUTTPCX and TOUCH have been rationalized after
     consultation with Douglas.  The commands now work as follows:

       (TOUCH rect cmd [cursor [picture [point]]])
       (BUTTPCX picture point header label cmd [cursor])

     Note that the second callback has disappeared from both TOUCH and
     BUTTPCX; use BODY instead.

 Revision 1.3.6.1  2002/06/06 05:47:30  emk
 3.3.4.1 - Began refactoring the Win5L interpreter to live behind an
 abstract interface.

   * Strictly limited the files which include Card.h and Macro.h.
   * Added TWin5LInterpreter class.
   * Made as much code as possible use the TInterpreter interface.
   * Fixed a few miscellaneous build warnings.

 Revision 1.3  2002/05/15 11:05:33  emk
 3.3.3 - Merged in changes from FiveL_3_3_2_emk_typography_merge branch.
 Synopsis: The Common code is now up to 20Kloc, anti-aliased typography
 is available, and several subsystems have been refactored.  For more
 detailed descriptions, see the CVS branch.

 The merged Mac code hasn't been built yet; I'll take care of that next.

 Revision 1.2.2.2  2002/05/01 03:27:07  emk
 3.3.2.6 - First Windows engine with (textaa ...) command.

 - Implemented a primitive, slow Image::DrawPixMap command that uses
 ::GetPixel and ::SetPixel to do alpha blending (shudder).  Strangely
 enough, it's about as fast as the somewhat optimized Mac routines.
 Anyone got a good GDI book?

 - Fixed several assertion failures.

 Known problems:

 - Occasional assertion failure on exit.  The reference-counting on
 TIndexFile claims it's getting dereferenced too many times.  This is
 an old bug; all the TBTree and TBNode classes are pretty dodgy.

 - Assertion failure on "Special Variables" screen in 5Ltest.  This is
 caused by overlong lines.

 Revision 1.2.2.1  2002/04/30 07:57:31  emk
 3.3.2.5 - Port Win32 code to use the 20Kloc of Common code that now
 exists.  The (defstyle ...) command should work, but (textaa ...) isn't
 available yet.

 Next up: Implement the (textaa ...) command and the low-level
 GraphicsTools::Image::DrawBitMap.

 Revision 1.2  2002/02/19 12:35:12  tvw
 Bugs #494 and #495 are addressed in this update.

 (1) 5L.prefs configuration file introduced
 (2) 5L_d.exe will no longer be part of CVS codebase, 5L.prefs allows for
     running in different modes.
 (3) Dozens of compile-time switches were removed in favor of
     having a single executable and parameters in the 5L.prefs file.
 (4) CryptStream was updated to support encrypting/decrypting any file.
 (5) Clear file streaming is no longer supported by CryptStream
