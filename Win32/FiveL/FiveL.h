LIBRARY
    FiveL

OVERVIEW
	5L is a scripting language developed by the Interactive Media Lab
	at Dartmouth Medical School. The language has a basic set of commands
	that allow the scriptor to control both the media elements needed in
	the program and the logical structure needed to support interactivity.

FIVEL MACRO DEFINITIONS
	#define FIVEL_TIMER_MSECS<br>

 Revision 1.5  2002/06/20 16:32:54  emk
 Merged the 'FiveL_3_3_4_refactor_lang_1' branch back into the trunk.  This
 branch contained the following enhancements:

   * Most of the communication between the interpreter and the
     engine now goes through the interfaces defined in
     TInterpreter.h and TPrimitive.h.  Among other things, this
     refactoring makes will make it easier to (1) change the interpreter
     from 5L to Scheme and (2) add portable primitives that work
     the same on both platforms.
   * A new system for handling callbacks.

 I also slipped in the following, unrelated enhancements:

   * MacOS X fixes.  Classic Mac5L once again runs under OS X, and
     there is a new, not-yet-ready-for-prime-time Carbonized build.
   * Bug fixes from the "Fix for 3.4" list.

 Revision 1.4.6.1  2002/06/05 08:50:52  emk
 A small detour - Moved responsibility for script, palette and data directories
 from Config.{h,cpp} to FileSystem.{h,cpp}.

 Revision 1.4  2002/05/15 11:05:33  emk
 3.3.3 - Merged in changes from FiveL_3_3_2_emk_typography_merge branch.
 Synopsis: The Common code is now up to 20Kloc, anti-aliased typography
 is available, and several subsystems have been refactored.  For more
 detailed descriptions, see the CVS branch.

 The merged Mac code hasn't been built yet; I'll take care of that next.

 Revision 1.3.2.1  2002/04/30 07:57:31  emk
 3.3.2.5 - Port Win32 code to use the 20Kloc of Common code that now
 exists.  The (defstyle ...) command should work, but (textaa ...) isn't
 available yet.

 Next up: Implement the (textaa ...) command and the low-level
 GraphicsTools::Image::DrawBitMap.

 Revision 1.3  2002/02/19 12:35:12  tvw
 Bugs #494 and #495 are addressed in this update.

 (1) 5L.prefs configuration file introduced
 (2) 5L_d.exe will no longer be part of CVS codebase, 5L.prefs allows for
     running in different modes.
 (3) Dozens of compile-time switches were removed in favor of
     having a single executable and parameters in the 5L.prefs file.
 (4) CryptStream was updated to support encrypting/decrypting any file.
 (5) Clear file streaming is no longer supported by CryptStream

 For more details, refer to ReleaseNotes.txt

 Revision 1.2  2002/01/23 20:39:20  tvw
 A group of changes to support a new stable build.

 (1) Only a single instance of the FiveL executable may run.

 (2) New command-line option "-D" used to lookup the installation directory in the system registry.
     Note: Underscores will be parsed as spaces(" ").
     Ex: FiveL -D HIV_Prevention_Counseling

 (3) Slow down the flash on buttpcx so it can be seen on
     fast machines.  A 200 mS pause was added.

 (4) Several bugfixes to prevent possible crashes when error
     conditions occur.

 Revision 1.1  2001/09/24 15:11:00  tvw
 FiveL v3.00 Build 10

 First commit of /iml/FiveL/Release branch.

 There are now seperate branches for development and release
 codebases.
