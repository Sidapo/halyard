  ;;  Node Trampolines
  ;;=======================================================================
  ;;  A "trampoline" is traditionally a tricky little piece of machine code
  ;;  that is used to redirect function calls.  Trampolines are usually
  ;;  generated at runtime.  See the Jargon File[1] for details.
  ;;
  ;;  In a linker, trampolines may be "snapped"--the first time you call a
  ;;  function, you actually call a trampoline.  The trampoline calls the
  ;;  linker, which finds the correct function to call.  The linker then
  ;;  overwrites the trampoline with a pointer to the actual function.  So
  ;;  the next time you call the function, you bypass the linker.
  ;;
  ;;  A %static-node-trampoline% is a proxy for an unloaded node.  It can
  ;;  respond to a few simple methods directly.  But as soon as you try to
  ;;  do anything complicated with it, it will actually load the real node
  ;;  in from disk and then "snap" itself out existence.
  ;;
  ;;  Just to make life exciting, a %static-node-trampoline% is actually
  ;;  emulating a _class_, not an instance.  So that affects things like
  ;;  .instance-of? and .subclass-of?.
