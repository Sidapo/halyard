  ;;; When a %node% ATTR is updated, we frequently need to redraw the node,
  ;;; pass the update to C++, or run some other small snippet of code.  This
  ;;; can be achieved with code like the following:
  ;;;
  ;;;   (after-updating at
  ;;;     (set-engine-pos! self (.at)))
  ;;;
  ;;;   (after-updating [style text]
  ;;;     (.invalidate))
  ;;;
  ;;; Note that we also provide a non-macro version of this API.  See
  ;;; %node% .after-updating.
  ;;;
  ;;; Code installed by AFTER-UPDATING won't do anything until _after_
  ;;; .initialize has finished, to prevent object initialization from
  ;;; accidentally triggering update handlers.
