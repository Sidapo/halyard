;; Metadata support for static nodes.
(module metadata-attr (lib "mizzen.ss" "mizzen")
  (require (lib "nodes.ss" "halyard/private"))

  (provide metadata-attr)

  ;;; Define a new metadata attribute on a subclass of %node%.  Metadata
  ;;; attributes are weird consequence of our static/running node system,
  ;;; and they should be used sparingly.  An example:
  ;;;
  ;;;   (define-class %group% (%card%)
  ;;;     (metadata-attr ordered? #t)
  ;;;     ...)
  ;;;
  ;;;   (group /levels (%group% :ordered? #f)
  ;;;     ...)
  ;;;
  ;;;   (/levels .ordered?) ; returns #f
  ;;;
  ;;; Here, /levels is actually a class.  When we enter the group /levels,
  ;;; we instantiate it and assign values to ordinary ATTRs.  But every
  ;;; once in a while, we need to access an attribute on the static node.
  ;;; METADATA-ATTR is a slighly hackish solution to this problem: It
  ;;; defines a read-only attribute on a static node, but allows the value
  ;;; of the attribute to be specified as though it were an ordinary ATTR.
  ;;;
  ;;; For now, METADATA-ATTR is very limited, and should be used with
  ;;; caution.  Specifically:
  ;;;
  ;;;  1) Always supply a default value.
  ;;;
  ;;;  2) Both the default value and the value passed in a static node's
  ;;;     argument list should generally be constants, not expressions.  In
  ;;;     any case, we evaluate the initializer immediately, so stay far
  ;;;     away from things like MAKE-HASH-TABLE.

    ;; Add the methods needed to implement a metadata attribute.  Metadata
    ;; attributes need to be special in two ways.
    ;;
    ;; 1) We need to be able to override metadata in subclasses and when
    ;;    defining static nodes.  Class-level attributes aren't normally
    ;;    overridable though, since they don't follow the initialization
    ;;    protocol.  Since metadata attributes are always read-only,
    ;;    instead of actually declaring them as attributes, we just define
    ;;    overridable getters, and override them on any level of the
    ;;    hierarchy that we need to.
    ;;
    ;; 2) We would like to be able to override the value of a metadata
    ;;    attribute when declaring a node using the keyword arguments on a
    ;;    static node.  Normally, this sets up attr-initializers on the
    ;;    class, which handle how instances of the class are set up, but we
    ;;    override .ATTR-INITIALIZER to instead define a getter method on
    ;;    the class (aka static node) with the appropriate value.
    ;;
    ;;    This also leads to the somewhat strange consequence that the way
    ;;    you override the value of a metadata attribute in a subclass is
    ;;    by using (default ordered? ...) in the class body itself, not a
    ;;    (with-instance (.class) ...), even though this is effectively a
    ;;    class-level attribute.
    ;;
    ;; Note that using VALUE for a metadata attribute will keep subclasses
    ;; from overriding it by sealing the getter method.  This basically
    ;; corresponds to the way VALUE works for regular attributes, to reduce
    ;; surprise.
