;;  Initializing Library Collection Paths
;;=========================================================================
;;  Before we can use any of load and require machinery, we need to have a
;;  sane set of collection paths set up.  We want to include the following
;;  in our collection paths:
;;    * Scripts
;;    * Runtime
;;    * The standard PLT collections
;;  The standard PLT collections may be in any of a variety of locations
;;  depending on how we're being run, whether it be on Windows or a *nix,
;;  whether we're running development or deployed code, etc.

;; Note that this file can't (require ...) anything other than
;; #%engine-primitives, because we have no collection paths set up when
;; we load it.  That's also why this file is separate from loader.ss.
(require #%engine-primitives)

;; Top-level code, not a module, because we want to execute immediately,
;; and not get caught by PLT's weird delayed initialization of modules.  We
;; wrap everything in a (let [] ...) to avoid polluting the top-level
;; namespace.
(let []

  ;; Ask C++ where the engine is keeping its runtime files.
  (define $runtime-directory (%get-runtime-directory))

  ;; Find the default collects-dir built into our executable.  This
  ;; path may be relative to exec-file's parent directory.  This will
  ;; let us know where PLT thinks it should be finding its
  ;; collections.
  (define (default-plt-collects-dir)
    (call-with-values (lambda () (split-path (find-system-path 'exec-file)))

          (if (eq? base 'relative)
            (path->complete-path collects)

     ;; the value of (find-system-path 'collects-dir) doesn't get set up
     ;; correctly.  But on those systems, we can generally find our
     ;; collections under 'addon-dir.  This path would, in any case, get
     ;; added to current-library-collection-paths by
     ;; find-library-collection-paths, so everything will _appear_ to work
     ;; until we invoke the compilation manager.
     ;;
     ;; But we _really_ need to set up 'collects-dir correctly, or else
     ;; setup/main-collects.ss will be unable to compute
     ;; main-collects-relative->path correctly for the compilation manager.
     (build-path (find-system-path 'addon-dir) (version) "collects")
