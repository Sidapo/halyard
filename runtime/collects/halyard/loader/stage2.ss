  ;; Normally, we shouldn't be requiring any files here, because we haven't
  ;; set up the compilation manager yet, and we're not allowed to load
  ;; files now that will be used later by compiled modules, on pain of
  ;; severely confusing the compilation manager.
  ;;
  ;; But the following file is _sometimes_ required by the compilation
  ;; manager, and sometimes not required.  Unfortunately, this prevents us
  ;; from reliably calculating the number of files that will be loaded, and
  ;; therefore messes up the progress bar code.
  ;;
  ;; Fortunately, the compilation manager turns itself off before loading
  ;; this file (using dynamic-require), and nobody else needs to load this
  ;; file at all.  So it is theoretically safe to load this here if we want
  ;; to.  For now, we're going to load this up front, and stabilize the
  ;; number of files we load later on.
  ;;
  ;; If this stops working, then we need to remove this require statement,
  ;; and instead patch notify-file-load/use-compiled to ignore this file
  ;; when calling our various progress-bar-related functions.
