;; When developing Quake 2 levels, it becomes annoying to have to keep
;; using "noclip" and voyaging to specific spots on the level.  Here is an
;; API which can be used for jumping around in a controlled way.  We do not
;; recommend using this for anything but level development, because the
;; underlying "teleport" command is shady.
;;
;; To use: See DEFINE-QUAKE2-TELEPORT-LOCATION to set up named locations
;; (with optional associated code), and type "goto location-name" on the
;; Quake 2 console to jump to those locations.  To get x, y, z and yaw
;; information, use the "pos" command on the Quake 2 console.
