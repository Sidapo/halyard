  ;;  any Scheme but PLT.  Examples:
  ;;
  ;;    (foo .layout :desired-width 50)
  ;;    (set! (@title .text) "Hello!")
  ;;
  ;;  When there is a SELF variable in scope, you can also write:
  ;;
  ;;    (.layout :desired-width 50)
  ;;    (set! (.text) "Hello!")
  ;;
  ;;  Note that this code may interact with various Swindle internals in
  ;;  unpleasant ways.  Swindle's SETF!, in particular, contains code to
  ;;  deal with #%APP, and may start complaining about SET-#%APP! if it
  ;;  doesn't recognize our version of #%APP as such.  So if you have
  ;;  problems, make sure that SETF! is doing the right thing.
  ;;
  ;;  We also provide a (SLOT 'foo) macro which accesses a private storage
  ;;  slot named FOO associated with SELF.  This only works if SELF is in
  ;;  scope--by not exporting SLOT%, etc., which work for any object, we
  ;;  make object slots semi-private.
