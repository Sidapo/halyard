Halyard (formerly known as 5L and Tamale) has a long history.  The earliest
versions date back to the late 80s, when it played movies using a Laserdisc
player.  Much of the engine has been incrementally rewritten since 2002,
with only a few low-level files remaining from earlier versions.

If you're adding a new feature to Halyard, please feel free to add yourself
to this file.

We only have version control history back to 1999, so we may have missed
some of the earlier maintainers.  If you have any information to add about
the original authors, please let us know!

This file uses the same format as the Linux CREDITS file.  Linus writes:
"The fields are: name (N), email (E), web-address (W), PGP key ID and
fingerprint (P), description (D), and snail-mail address (S)."  We also use
a time-period field (T) for old 5L maintainers.  For more recent
maintainers, time periods can be found using "git log --author='First Last'".
