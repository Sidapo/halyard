FiveL (common) Release Notes:
-----------------------------

February 26, 2002 03:30 PM - Eric Kidd

* Merged back in support for the Macintosh platform.  This is an ongoing
  process, and we'll need to do more work.

* Separated out platform specific configuration with big block comments.

* Merged in a few changes from KBTree which appeared to fix bugs.

* Merged in IntToString, UIntToString, DoubleToString changes from the
  Macintosh engine, and improved the error handling.  NOTE: doubles now
  print using "%f" (the way the Mac engine always did it).  This means
  that "tstr = 0.0" will set 'tstr' to "0.000000", not "0" (as it
  did in the Win32 engine).

* Added Makefile.am and configure.in so I can build these utility classes
  under Linux.

* Implemented a ridiculously simple unit-testing library.  This will
  be improved in future releases.

* Wrote test suites for the portions of the TString that I touched.
