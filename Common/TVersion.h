 $Log$
 Revision 1.98  2005/08/23 17:37:15  emk
 0.0.57 - 23 Aug 2005 - emk

   * Added support for many new named entities, including &alpha;, &beta;,
     and &gamma; (for discussing radiation).
   * Added support for numeric entities (e.g., &#8225; for double-dagger).
   * Removed lots of legacy code for non-Unicode encodings.

 Revision 1.97  2005/08/18 16:50:21  emk
 0.0.56 - 18 Aug 2005 - emk

   * Don't show "Tamale" in application name when in runtime mode (bug #1728).
   * Display script icons when in runtime mode (bug #1728).
   * Added POINT-IN-SHAPE? (bug #2086).
   * Added support for floating zones in a separate layer when dragging
     them (bug #2085).

 Revision 1.96  2005/07/27 19:16:37  emk
 0.0.55 - 27 July 2005 - emk

   * Added NOPUSH flag for FUNC_DOOR objects in Quake.  This flag should
     make doors "polite"--they won't push you, they won't damage you,
     and they'll snap open instantly if they hit you.  And if the doors
     snap open, they won't mess up the trigger's toggle state (bug #1769).
   * We now send MEDIA-FINISHED events for Vorbis audio streams (bug #2052).

 Revision 1.95  2005/07/26 17:16:37  emk
 0.0.54 - 26 July 2005 - emk

   * Added FREEZE command which can be called from the Quake 2 console to
     freeze/unfreeze the player in place instantly.  Without arguments,
     FREEZE toggles the current state, but you can also pass in an explicit
     ON or OFF argument.  For odd technical reasons, you can't crouch while
     frozen.  This feature requires a new engine as well as a new
     gamex86.dll for best results (bug #1817, partial).
   * Added FREEZES and REGION_NAME fields to FUNC_WALL objects in Quake 2.
     When the player hits a wall with a FREEZES field, the player is
     immediately frozen as though they had issued a "FREEZE ON" command.
     When the player hits a wall with a REGION_NAME field, the state-db key
     /quake2/hit-wall?/wallname is set to #t (bug #1817, partial).
   * Added explicit "ON" and "OFF" arguments to the "GOD" and "NOTARGET"
     commands in Quake 2.  As with the new FREEZE command, the optional
     arguments will also surpress console output (bug #1769, partial).

 Revision 1.94  2005/07/22 14:02:40  emk
 0.0.53 - 22 July 2005 - brian, emk

   * Fixed the occasionally broken indentation and highlighting of
     special forms (bug #2033).
   * Crash reporter bugfixes (bug #2032):
     - The crash reporter no longer fails if it the stack contains
       a corrupt wxString instance.  This is a patch pulled from
       upstream wxWidgets CVS and applied by hand.
     - If the crash reporter itself crashes, we attempt to just pop
       up a simple error dialog and exit.
     - We now catch wxWidget assertion failures and feed them to
       the crash reporter.
   * If the Stage loses its mouse grab unexpectedly, it now attempts
     to do something reasonable (bug #2032).
   * Nightly build scripts have been fixed.
   * Added support for automatically generated make-classname
     functions, class predicates, slot getters and setters to tags.ss
     (bug #1972).
   * Added support for defining new syntax taggers to tags.ss (bug
     #1972).
   * We no longer override OnAssert in the Release build (where it
     doesn't exist, anyway).
   * Added a IML_Q2_TOTAL_CONVERSION preprocessor macro which can be
     used to remove Quake 2's dependence on certain files.  This only
     includes files which can't be easily replaced by dummy files (bug #1688).

 Revision 1.93  2005/07/15 12:44:35  emk
 0.0.52 - 14 July 2005 - emk

   * Made HEARTBEAT a non-logging primitive.
   * Reset wxUSE_DISPLAY to 1 to re-enable full-screen mode after upgrade.
   * Major crash reporter enhancements (bug #1712, partial).
     - Crash reports for scripts go to a separate web site.
     - Reports include script name and version.
     - Reports include the current and previous card names.
     - Reports include a build timestamp and crash timestamp.
     - Script crash reports include a screenshot!
     - Reports include processor information.
     - REGISTER-DEBUG-REPORT-FILE! can be used to include extra files
       in the crash report, as requested by scripters.
   * Bumped data.tam file version and implemented simple format migration.
   * Added wxHyperLink class from wxcode.sf.net for future use.
   * Made wxHyperLink::ExecuteLink public.
   * Updated installer for new crash reporter.
   * Made some fixes to nightly build script.
   * Documented wxWidgets upgrade procedure.

 Revision 1.92  2005/07/13 20:44:55  emk
 0.0.51 - 13 July 2005 - emk

   * Replaced CrashRpt with wxDebugReport.  Not all features are
     implemented yet; this is a work in progress (bug #1712, partial).
   * Added code to submit debug reports to the server (bug #1712, partial).
   * Fixed bug which caused wxDebugReport to generate invalid XML.

 Revision 1.91  2005/07/12 17:10:12  emk
 0.0.50 - 12 July 2005 - emk

   * Added &deg; character (bug #2000).
   * Upgraded our included wxWidgets to 2.6.1, and modified some engine
     code to use new wxWidgets APIs (bug #1712, partial).  We also
     reapplied the following patches which had been backed out before
     the upgrade:
       - wx.rc: Build dependency hack.
       - stc: Lots of local LISP-mode tweaking.
       - evtloop: Hacked in *another* set of event loop hooks.
   * Fixed bugs introduced by LexLisp.cpp merge (bug #2004, bug #2005).
   * Fixed QuickTime black-rectangle bug introduced by wx 2.6.1 (bug #2007),
     and cleaned up other problems caused by calling wxWindow::Create()
     automatically before setting up object options.
   * Fixed custom build step broken by wx 2.6.1.

 Revision 1.90  2005/07/08 17:25:44  emk
 0.0.49 - 8 July 2005 - emk, brian

   * Added MoveTo and Origin to TPolygon, and allowed Zone elements to
     be moved. Runtime support for this will be added later.
   * Fixed exception-handling bug in TSchemeInterpreter::Call5LPrim
     which corrupted C++ exception-handling state.  We *think* this
     should cure several of our most annoying hard-to-reproduce bugs
     (bug #1691, bug #1762, believed fixed).
   * Fixed test-suite failure introduced by HEARTBEAT function.
   * Fixed buggy call to Sys_Error in qoverlay.cpp (bug #1989, partial)
     and increased the maximum number of overlays (bug #1897).
   * Fixed "Not Responding" timeout during initial startup on slow machines
     by calling ::PeekMessage before and after every *.zo compilation
     (bug #1898).
   * Give reasonable errors for missing Vorbis files (bug #1993).

 Revision 1.89  2005/07/05 16:39:28  emk
 0.0.48 - 5 July 2005 - emk, brian

   * Added COPY-STRING-TO-CLIPBOARD function for use by developer tool
     libraries.
   * Fixed bug in AudioStream::StreamsAreRunning().
   * Converted AudioStream to use a background thread instead of a
     timer (bug #1716, partial).
   * AudioStream now does initial Idle() in backround, which should
     make it possible to start audio without clobbering 3D performance.
     Some clean-up still required (bug #1716, partial).
   * AudioStream threading code cleanup finished (bug #1716).  The
     BACKGROUND_START_AFTER_PRELOAD code is still in place, but turned off.
     If testing doesn't reveal any stuttering at the start of audio
     playback, we'll delete it and simplify the audio classes considerably.
   * Fixed bug where PortAudio would sometimes fail to shut down a stream
     properly.
   * Added logging code to report screen aspect ratios and suspected
     "merged" monitors (bug #1934, partial).
   * Fixed the bug which caused italic text to be cut off at the end of
     a line (bug #1955).
   * Fixed About box to use correct #define to get versions.
   * Fixed missing icon bugs for Listener and other windows.
   * Hacked ScriptEditorDB to attempt to clean up duplicate file
     entries with different case, i.e., "R1.ss" and "r1.ss".  This
     code is a bit kludgy because it tries to avoid expensive and
     complicated file I/O.
   * Added :VOLUME parameter to all media elements.
   * Fixed QuickTime SET-MEDIA-VOLUME! and :VOLUME support to
     actually work.  (The original code was simply broken.)

 Revision 1.88  2005/06/21 18:51:41  emk
   * Added icons for new script/definition tree.
   * Clicking on folders jumps to definition
   * Refactored layout-saving code from StageFrame to SashFrame.

 Revision 1.87  2005/02/04 21:44:44  emk
 0.0.46 - 4 Feb 2005 - tryon, emk, naomi

 Major editor improvements:

   * You can use Alt-. to jump to the script for the currently running
     card, and to look up the definition of functions in the editor.
   * The editor now displays call tips after you type a function name.
   * Fixed a crash when the user hit Control-E on the loading screen.
   * Added a simple ScriptEditorDB class to support Meta-dot lookups
     of definitions.
   * Heavily overhauled ScriptEditorDB to use transactions more extensively,
     run faster, and provide better APIs to the ScriptEditor.
   * Fixed SQLite3 to automatically destroy reader objects.

 Other changes:

   * Added Quake 2 variable 'cl_disablemenu' which allows the Quake 2
     menu system to be disabled and replaced with a custom "escape"
     binding (bug #1740).

 Revision 1.86  2004/12/15 23:34:23  emk
   * Added support for Alt-Tab out of full-screen mode (bug #1726).
   * Added code to hide and show the taskbar (bug #1726).

 Revision 1.85  2004/12/13 21:36:04  emk
 0.0.44 - 13 Dec 2004 - emk

   * Added splash screen with graphic and copyright notice (bug #1725).
   * The screen-resizing code is now polite--it asks first, confirms
     afterwards, and stores prefs based on system screen geometry.
     You can override it by holding down "shift" when Tamale switches
     into full-screen mode.

 Revision 1.84  2004/12/13 16:56:05  emk
 Added splash screen with graphic and copyright notice (bug #1725).

 Revision 1.83  2004/12/13 12:45:39  emk
 0.0.43 - 13 Dec 2004 - emk

   * Added QUICKTIME-COMPONENT-VERSION primitive.
   * Removed the kInitializeQTMLUseGDIFlag from QuickTime startup. This
     will once again allow us to use hardware acceleration, with possible
     negative consequences. Keep an eye out for QuickTime bugs on weird
     machines for the next month or two.
   * Made sure we call scheme_set_stack_base with a second argument of 1 to
     prevent the Boehm GC from scanning video card memory mapped into our
     address space by QuickTime (which is hideously slow).  We've been
     neglecting this fix for a while because we've been using
     kInitializeQTMLUseGDIFlag, which keeps QuickTime from mapping video
     memory.
   * We now detect if QuickTime isn't installed and give an appropriate
     error (bug #1846).
   * We handle top-level exceptions much more gracefully and informatively
     than before (bug #1846).
   * We no longer register elements with the stage before they're fully
     created. This fixes the bug where throwing an exception in an element
     constructor would crash the engine (bug #1836).
   * The engine now preforms delayed wake-ups of the interpreter (after the
     end of a WAIT) more robustly, which should fix some ugly assertion
     failures (bug #1845). I'm convinced this portion of the code will need
     a redesign, and have added some comments to that effect.
   * The engine no longer crashes if you press control-space in a
     simulation (bug #1838).  When the engine goes into edit mode, it
     now deletes all elements and any StateDB listeners registered by the
     script.
   * The error dialog no longer floats over all other windows (bug #1829).
   * Basic runtime mode implemented.  This supports launching directly to
     full-screen mode with a specified script, and disabling editing options
     if 5L.prefs is missing (bug #1726).  As noted in the bug, a number of
     other issues remain, and we'll have to deal with them before declaring
     the runtime mode perfect.
   * Added code to update menu accelerators more reliably while in runtime
     mode (bug #1726).  This may cause performance problems.
   * All script errors are fatal in runtime mode (bug #1730).

 Revision 1.82  2004/12/09 18:01:56  emk
 0.0.42 - 06 Dec 2004 - emk

   * EVENT-STALE? no longer gets confused if your system has been
     up for more than 49.7/2 days (bug #1779).

 Revision 1.81  2004/11/08 21:47:22  emk
 0.0.40 - 08 Nov 2005 - emk

   * Added ANIMATE function.
   * Modified Tamale to use standard open file dialogs (bug #1713).
   * Upgraded FreeType from 2.1.4rc1 to 2.1.9.  Text may look different--
     supposedly better.  This will allow us to start fixing low-level
     FreeType bugs.
   * Fixed calculation of nominal point sizes to be compatible with
     new FreeType version, which appears to be better documented in
     this respect.
   * Added code to make sure we position the StageFrame on the actual
     display (part of bug #1272).
   * The engine no longer crashes if errors or jumps occur in (ON EXIT ...)
     handlers--instead, we report the error and continue with the original
     jump (bug #1761).

 Revision 1.80  2004/09/21 11:47:58  emk
 0.0.39 - 21 Sep 2004 - emk

   * Quake 2 no longer places the cursor outside the window when running
     on the left-hand monitor of a two-monitor system.  However, under
     certain complicated circumstances (that shouldn't come up for users
     running in full screen mode) it is now possible to make the Quake 2
     player spin continuously (bug #1739, mostly fixed).
   * Fixed assertion failure during transitions where the dirty rectangle
     didn't fit on the screen (bug #1753).  This was a dumb error.

 Revision 1.79  2004/09/20 13:22:57  emk
 0.0.38 - 20 Sep 2004 - emk

   * Fixed bug: Engine no longer tries to wake up interpreter if interpreter
     doesn't exist.
   * Fixed bug #1271: Calling %kernel-pause from a callback no longer
     crashes the engine.
   * Fixed bug #1729: We give appropriate errors if the user calls illegal
     functions from inside a callback (instead of sometimes crashing).  The
     prohibited list is WAIT, NAP, TIMEOUT and the modal text input stuff.
   * Fixed bug #1746: Screen resizing code turned back on.
   * Miscellaneous cleanup in typography code.  I was trying to track down a
     bug--which turns out to probably be in FreeType--but this reworked code
     is clearer and better.  The actual bug fix will wait until we upgrade
     FreeType.

 Revision 1.78  2004/09/19 23:25:02  emk
 0.0.37 - 19 Sep 2004 - emk

   * Warning fixes.
   * Fixed bug #1687: Suspending and restoring Tamale in the inventory
     screen no longer causes Quake 2 to lock the cursor.
   * Fixed bug #1695: WAIT now works for Vorbis audio.  This is still
     slightly experimental, but please start playing around.  Remember, we
     can't stream Vorbis yet.
   * Fixed bug #1706: Scheme ASSERT is no longer fatal, which means it can
     be used to report user errors.  %ASSERT can still be used to report
     kernel errors, and will mail a bug report.  This makes a number of
     engine-crashing bugs non-fatal script bugs.
   * Fixed bug #1738: In full screen mode, the engine automatically hides
     the cursor when there's nothing to click on.  This is still slightly
     experimental.  Some basic caveats:
       - QuickTime movies force the cursor to be shown only if they have a
         controller bar or they're interactive.
       - Other native widgets always force the cursor to be shown, including
         browsers, text boxes and ActiveX controls.
       - By default, zones and overlays only force the cursor to be shown if
         they have MOUSE-UP, MOUSE-DOWN, MOUSE-ENTER, MOUSE-LEAVE or
         MOUSE-MOVED handlers.  You can override this manually using the
         WANTS-CURSOR? property.
       - Cards with MOUSE-* handlers, but no zones, will not currently
         display a cursor.  This is half design decision and half bug; we'll
         wait for some experience before deciding one way or another.
       - The cursor doesn't always seem to update until you move the mouse.
         In particular, hidden cursors may not immediately become visible.
         So far, it *seems* that this is a Windows issue, but there's a
         chance Stage::OnIdle is doing something wrong.
       - "Show borders" uses red borders for elements which want a cursor,
         and grey borders for elements which don't care.
       - Zones which don't have WANTS-CURSOR? set will no longer participate
         in any mouse activities--they're effectively invisible to the
         mouse-handling code.
   * Fixed bug #1748: Crossfades can now be run during QuickTime movies.
     This required fixing the crossfader to only touch dirty portions of the
     screen, and to call wxApp::ProcessIdle between each frame so QuickTime
     doesn't starve for lack of CPU.  Unfortunately, fade durations are
     probably even less accurate by now, and won't get better unless I use
     high-resolution multimedia timers.

 Revision 1.77  2004/09/13 18:12:37  emk
 0.0.36 - 13 Sep 2004 - emk

   * Closing last tab when there are two or more tabs no longer
     causes an assertion failure.  The low-design still has issues,
     though, which we will need to address in a future refactoring.
   * Fixed bug #1690: We now completely clean up from (WAIT ...)
     when changing cards.
   * Fixed bug #1696: When notifying state-db listeners of changes,
     we watch out for listeners which delete other listeners.
   * Fixed bug #1697: Clicking on the stage without a script loaded
     no longer causes an assertion failure.
   * Fixed bug #1698: When "Reload Script" can't find the card
     it wants to jump to, it will jump to 'start' instead.
   * Fixed bug #1700: We now detect attempts to create nodes named
     '#f', and we check for duplicate node names earlier in the
     creation process, better preserving nodes.ss invariants.
   * Merged in lots of stuff from my laptop:
     - Preliminary sqlite3 integration for future use with editor.
     - More bsptools work.  This still doesn't run, but it provides
       pretty good documentation of how bsp files work.
     - Support for drawing lines in 3D while running Quake 2. This
       will be needed to debug AI, if we ever do AI.
     - Other minor tweaks and fixes.
     - A few preliminary warning fixes.  Much more to do.
   * Began work on smtpxx library.

 Revision 1.76  2004/09/10 15:40:13  emk
 0.0.35 - 09 Sep 2004 - emk

   * Began integration with CrashRpt library for crash reporting.

 Revision 1.75  2004/09/07 18:36:22  emk
 0.0.34 - 07 Sep 2004 - emk

   * More refactoring of DocNotebook in preparation for window splitting.
   * Added qtcheck project.  This is a DLL for use with InnoSetup; it
     allows installers to access the current QuickTime version, and the
     version of any QuickTime components.
   * The runtime now checks for different media locations automatically.
   * Added debug-var.ss for debugging local variables.
   * Fixed assertion failure in script editor.
   * Fixed debug build of qtcheck.
   * Added support for changing the font size in the script editor.
   * Added a :CLICKABLE-WHERE-TRANSPARENT? parameter to overlays, which
     makes them accept mouse-clicks even in completely transparent areas.

 Revision 1.74  2004/08/27 21:01:28  emk
 0.0.33 - 27 Aug 2004 - emk, madhura

 This engine has not been extensively tested; it's just a quick build to
 try out some ActiveX stuff.  See the test script for example code.

   * Quake 2 path-walking enhancements.
   * Support for embedding ActiveX controls.
   * Began refactoring of DocNotebook in editor, in preparation for window
     splitting support.

 Revision 1.73  2004/08/04 17:03:40  emk
 0.0.32 - 4 Aug 2004 - emk

   * Correct indentation of most special forms.
   * Support for [] braces in script editor.
   * Much smarter brace balancing code than is built into Scintilla.
   * Much more extensive syntax highlighting, including comments,
     characters, and many different types of identifiers.
   * Syntax highlighting automatically updates after Reload Scripts.
   * Bug fixes in file clobber detection code.
   * New Reload Scripts architecture--objects get notified automatically.
   * Support for viewing line numbers in script editor.

 Revision 1.72  2004/07/30 20:01:01  emk
 0.0.30 - 30 July 2004 - emk

 We have a new wxWidgets version:

   * Updated Tamale for latest CVS version of wxWidgets.
   * Worked around radio-button defaut selection bug.
   * Fixed assertion failure caused by latest wxWidgets.

 ...and a new text editor:

   * Added an editor widget based on wxStyledTextCtrl (i.e. Scintilla).
   * Started using FiveL namespace on Windows.
   * Added support for Scheme-style indentation.
   * Implemented a tabbed-document control.
   * Simple File, Edit and Search menus work.
   * Saving, opening and reloading work faily well.

 ...and some other stuff:

   * Small bug-fix to alpha-channel box outline code--stop drawing
     over the same area twice.

 0.0.29 - 02 June 2004 - emk, brian

   * Moved most of overlay support into quake2/client, except for
     actual drawing/conversion code.
   * Added a broken stub implementation of GL overlays.  This might
     actually work on some hardware, but seems to have driver issues
     on my laptop.
   * Added alpha channel support for horizontal lines, vertical lines
     and outlined boxes.  These should also now be drawn in identical
     locations regardless of graphics card and OS version.
   * Added clear-prefs!, clear-user-prefs!, and clear-global-prefs!, to
     support automatically clearing an entire preference file.

 Revision 1.71  2004/06/08 15:58:37  emk
 0.0.29 - emk, brian

   * Moved most of overlay support into quake2/client, except for
     actual drawing/conversion code.
   * Added a broken stub implementation of GL overlays.  This might
     actually work on some hardware, but seems to have driver issues
     on my laptop.
   * Added alpha channel support for horizontal lines, vertical lines
     and outlined boxes.  These should also now be drawn in identical
     locations regardless of graphics card and OS version.
   * Added clear-prefs!, clear-user-prefs!, and clear-global-prefs!, to
     support automatically clearing an entire preference file.

 Revision 1.70  2004/05/21 14:09:52  emk
 0.0.28 - 21 May 2004 - emk

 Re-enabled OpenGL drivers and implemented reticle support.  (Overlays do
 not work yet.)  You now need the wxref_soft.dll and wxref_gl.dll files to
 run Quake 2.

 To turn on GL, run "(set! (quake2-driver) 'gl)" before initializing Quake 2
 for the first time.  There are ways to switch video mode on the fly, but
 they're not entirely reliable.

   * Added a Vid_GetWindowPtr function to refimport_t for passing HWNDs
     and other data types through to the graphics driver.
   * Disabled second initialization of graphics drivers when running
     under wxWindows.
   * Added code to save r_projection_matrix during scene setup.
   * Implemented R_ProjectPoint duplicating GL vertex transform logic in
     software.
   * Modified ref_soft to get HWND from Vid_GetWindowPtr.
   * Modified Quake to prepend "wx" to DLL names when under wxWindows.
   * Added support for passing through driver name during Quake 2 init.

 Revision 1.69  2004/05/07 23:47:21  emk
 0.0.27 - 23 April 2004 - emk

 New compiler.  Test this engine thoroughly, and do not use it to update any
 of our programs until at least Wednesday of next week.

   * Updated to Visual Studio .NET to get access to the
     more-standards-compliant C++ compiler.  I'm tired of working around
     MSVC++ 6 bugs.

   * Worked around a fascinating compiler bug: No toolbar icons appeared
     when running Tamale because of breakage in wxDynamicCast.  It turns out
     that the wxClassInfo for wxBMPResourceHandler didn't include a correct
     m_baseInfo1 pointer.  This pointer was incorrect because
     wxBitmapHandler never got processed by wxClassInfo::InitializeClasses.
     *This*, in turn, occurred because the sm_first/m_next chain was broken
     at wxObject::sm_classwxObject.  *This* happened because the optimizer
     for the sm_classwxObject constructor could see the declaration
     'wxClassInfo* wxClassInfo::sm_first = NULL;' and optimized away the
     initialization 'm_next(sm_first)' because it assumed sm_first would
     still be NULL when the constructor was called (and because
     uninitialized fields default to NULL).  Solution: Turn off optimization
     for object.cpp in wxWindows.

     This is why you need to be able to read assembly.

 Revision 1.68  2004/04/23 14:47:18  emk
 0.0.25 - 23 April 2004 - emk

   * Updated boost C++ library to version 1.31.0.

   * Removed the remaining half-dozen CVS log comments, except for the
     one in TVersion.h.
   * Manually reformatted a few comments to the doxygen comment style.
   * Automatically reformatted zillions of standard-format comments to
     the doxygen style.
   * Added at least one sentence of documentation for all public classes in
     the main program, no matter how simple or obscure.

 Revision 1.67  2004/04/05 18:34:46  emk
   * Updated all copyright blocks for an open source release.
   * Removed the remaining half-dozen CVS log comments, except for the

 Revision 1.66  2004/03/11 20:33:41  emk
 0.0.25 - 11 March 2004 - emk

   * ESC no longer cancels looping movies.  It still cancels all other
     movies as before.

 Revision 1.65  2004/03/10 19:29:17  emk
 0.0.24 - 10 March 2004 - emk

   * Added STATE-DB-DEBUG function.
   * Added "trigger_region" entity to Quake 2.
   * Added support for ending WAITs from a callback.  Experimental.
   * More state-db support functions.
   * SYMCAT works like CAT, but returns symbols.

 Revision 1.64  2004/03/04 18:22:41  emk
 0.0.23 - 4 March 2004 - emk

   * Added (ON MEDIA-FINISHED (EVENT) ...) handler.
   * Added support for setting volume of QuickTime movies.
   * Added support for setting volume of GeigerSynthElement.
   * Moved EventDispatcher support into Element.
   * Fixed bug which caused engine to crash if you quit it while Quake 2
     was displayed.
   * Attemped to prevent wxWindows from erasing the wxWindow in which
     we're displaying QuickTime movies.
   * Added a few 'using boost::foo' directives.

 Revision 1.63  2004/03/01 18:03:36  emk
 0.0.22 - 1 March 2004 - emk

   * Made sure all Quake 2-related state db entries got cleared at Quake 2
     startup.
   * Implemented look_target, r_text, r_target, and r_activated_target.
   * Implemented basic reticle drawing.
   * Renamed r_activated_target -> r_look_target.

 Revision 1.62  2004/02/27 16:16:43  emk
 0.0.21 - 27 February 2004 - emk

   * Added support for using FOREACH to iterate over hash tables.
   * Allowed defaulted template parameters to be passed to parent template.
   * Added error message for unexpected template parameters.
   * Added error message for accessing template parameters which were never
     defined.
   * Allow templates to override parameter defaults in parent templates.
   * %ZONE% now takes an optional :AT parameter.  If this parameter is
     specified, then :SHAPE must be a rectangle at 0,0.
   * Moving zones in now much easier.  Drag and drop code will have to
     be changed.
   * %animated-graphic% now treats ../x and ../y as being relative to
     the overlay's official location.
   * %animated-graphic% now takes a symbol as a state-db path.
   * An element's position is now relative to the element's parent.
   * Elements move when their parents move.
   * POINT, RECT, etc., now print in a readable representation.
   * Added QUAKE2-RUNNING? function.
   * %geiger-synth% now relies on the state-db to determine how many
     counts per second to play.

 Revision 1.61  2004/02/23 23:21:41  emk
 0.0.20 - 23 February - emk, djin

   * Added support for MATCH-LET.
   * Wrote a REAL->STRING function which can format floating point numbers
     reasonably well.
   * Added 5L-Prim PolygonContains that uses the TPolygon contains method.
   * Fixed ugly redraw flicker when updating overlays above Quake 2.

 Revision 1.60  2004/02/19 23:12:59  emk
 0.0.19 - 19 February 2004 - kwasi, djin, emk

   * Added code to detect infinite cycles in TStateDB changes.
   * Added tamale-tags.sh script for Emacs users.
   * Added new Quake 2 console trigger command to activate targets.
   * Provide a whole new API for state db listeners: STATE-DB-FN,
     STATE-DB-FN/RT, REGISTER-STATE-DB-LISTENER!,
     DEFINE-STATE-DB-LISTENER, and DEFINE-STATE-DB-LISTENER/RT.
   * Fixed a bug (I hope) which caused Quake commands to have extra
     text appended to the end of the command string.
   * Implemented core of realtime Scheme interpreter.  This isn't very
     fast, but it never generates Scheme garbage.
   * Removed old STATE-DB-CHANGED event-handling code.  Use the new
     listener system instead; it's happy.
   * Wrote serialization code for binmsg protocol.
   * Wrote deserialization code for binmsg protocol.
   * Implemented binmsg support in stock gamex86.dll, client, wxquake2
     and Tamale.
   * Added countdown template in scheme

 Revision 1.59  2004/02/16 16:08:21  emk
 0.0.18 - 15 February 2004 - emk

 Added support for attaching elements to any node, not just cards.  This
 includes groups, sequences, and other elements.  When dynamically creating
 an element, there are two ways to specify what parent it should have.
 First, you can use the :PARENT argument to CREATE:

   (create %my-elem% :parent self :silly 'foo)

 Second, you can use the WITH-DEFAULT-ELEMENT-PARENT special form:

   (with-default-element-parent self
     (create %my-elem% :silly 'foo))

 WITH-DEFAULT-ELEMENT-PARENT is dynamically scoped, which means that it
 affects calls to CREATE within any subroutine called during its duration.

 If you use neither :PARENT nor WITH-DEFAULT-ELEMENT-PARENT, then the engine
 will attach nodes to the current card.  (There is no current card when
 initializing groups and sequences.)  You can call DEFAULT-ELEMENT-PARENT
 to get the default parent used by CREATE.  The functions ELEMENT-EXISTS?
 and DELETE-ELEMENT-IF-EXISTS now operate on the default element parent
 unless told otherwise.

   * Allowed elements to be attached to any node, not just cards.
   * Added WITH-DEFAULT-ELEMENT-PARENT, DEFAULT-ELEMENT-PARENT, and
     :PARENT argument to CREATE.
   * Removed the need for :TEMPLATE to be used when declaring nodes or
     other templates.
   * Added CURRENT-GROUP-MEMBER function, which (for want of a better name)
     reports the card, sequence or group which is currently the topmost
     active element in the event handling stack.
   * CURRENT-CARD will now raise an error if no card is active.
   * We now check for attempts to attach handlers or elements to inactive
     nodes.
   * You can access the elements on a node with NODE-ELEMENTS.
   * @* now takes a :IF-NOT-FOUND argument.  By default, this argument
     raises an error if no matching node is found.
   * Major overhaul of entering and exiting nodes.
   * The engine no longer relies on TInterpreterManager to get the name
     of the current card.  Instead, it gets the card name through
     a parameter to NotifyEnterCard.
   * A recent bug which caused the engine to exit unnecessarily due to
     load time errors should now be fixed.
   * Updated tamale.ss.

 Revision 1.58  2004/02/12 15:34:57  emk
 0.0.17 - kwasi, djin, emk

   * Added APIs for accessing TStateDB from Scheme.
   * Implemented %animated-graphic% with corresponding AnimatedOverlay class.
   * Added support for (ON EXIT () ...) handlers.
   * Updated Quake 2 game interface.

 Revision 1.57  2004/02/09 19:53:28  emk
 0.0.16 - kwasi, djin, emk

   * Cleaned up a whole bunch of legacy code that can be much simpler now
     that we have TValue.
   * Removed TObject, TArray and TBTree because they have overstayed their
     welcome by about a decade.
   * Cleaned up settyped.
   * Added output operator for TValue containing TNull().
   * Added input operator for extracting from a TArgumentList into
     a TValue.
   * Fixed TRect argument order (finally!).
   * Deleted TString and TURL.
   * Added TStateDB class.
   * Added preliminary support for running Quake 2 in the background.
   * Added support for showing and hiding elements in both Tamale and Quake 2.
   * Deleted tons of old code which wasn't doing anything any more.

 Revision 1.56  2004/01/31 00:21:42  emk
 0.0.15 - 30 Jan 2004 - emk, kwasi, djin

 Two major new features: Tamale overlays can now float over Quake 2
 (graphically, at least--input hasn't been implemented), and the Scheme/C++
 value-passing interface has been extensively revamped.  Expect a few
 glitches.

 TValue work (kwasi, djin, emk):

   * Implemented TValue class, with full test cases.
   * Added a TCallbackPtr typedef (using a shared pointer) and an
     output operator.
   * Added TestCase.h to CommonHeaders.h.
   * Added macros REGISTER_TEST_CASE_FILE and REFERENCE_TEST_CASE_FILE
     to TestCase.h and used them in TestAll.cpp.
   * Documented TValue and moved as much code as possible into TValue.cpp.
   * Reorganized TSchemeInterpreter and began work on conversion functions.
   * TValueToScheme can now convert almost all TValue types.
   * Patched swindle's EQUALS? function to compare lists recursively with
     EQUALS? instead of EQUAL?.
   * Added a CheckFuncHelper to TestCase.h for programmers who need to
     define custom versions of CHECK_EQ, etc.
   * Exported %kernel-equals from the kernel so C++ can test for equality
     of two Scheme values.
   * Added TInterpreter::MakeSchemePolygon and MakeSchemePercent.
   * Deleted TCallbackArgumentList and TSchemeCallbackArgumentList, and
     replaced them with much simpler TValueList code.
   * Re-arranged headers a bit, and added new files to CommonHeaders.h.
   * Removed all redundant includes of TValue.h and GraphicsTools.h.
   * Finished SchemeToTValue conversions.
   * Replaced TCallback* with TCallbackPtr (a smart pointer) everywhere.
   * TArgumentList no longer needs language-specific subclasses--it uses
     TValueList.
   * TValue can now do a few limited sorts of numeric type conversions.
   * Lots of little bug fixes and stress testing related to TValue.
   * Removed SET primitive.
   * Replaced TVariable/TVariableManager with TValue/new-TVariableManager.
   * Implemented operator<< for many basic types used by TValue.
   * Removed FindVariable and Assign.
   * Made TVariableManager::Get throw errors when trying to read a
     non-existant variable.

 Revision 1.55  2004/01/13 21:10:46  emk
 0.0.14 - 13 Jan 2004 - emk

 Vastly improved web browser integration, including the ability to embed
 Internet Explorer using wxIE.

 Scripting API changes:

   * HTML-related commands replaced with BROWSER-related commands.  See
     tamale.ss for details.
   * LOAD-PICTURE -> DRAW-PICTURE
   * WITH-DRAWING-CONTEXT -> WITH-DC
   * DRAWING-CONTEXT-RECT -> DC-RECT
   * PROP-BY-NAME -> PROP*
   * @-BY-NAME -> @*
   * SEND-BY-NAME replaced by more flexible SEND*
   * New syntax for relative pathnames: (@ relpath) -> @relpath
   * Added a MEASURE-PICTURE command.
   * Added an OFFSET-RECT command.
   * New MOUSE-GRABBED-BY? function.
   * New ENABLED? property on %BASIC-BUTTON%.
   * Support for (ON SETUP-FINISHED () ...) handlers.
   * New event types: BROWSER-NAVIGATE, BROWSER-PAGE-CHANGED,
     STATUS-TEXT-CHANGED, PROGRESS-CHANGED, UPDATE-UI, BROWSER-TITLE-CHANGED.

 Other engine changes:

   * Added BrowserElement class to represent all web-browser-like elements.
     This includes foward/back/stop and set of standard events.
   * Added BrowserElementWx class to wrap the built-in wxHtmlWindow class.
   * Added BrowserElementIE class to wrap the wxIEHtmlWin class.
   * Support for vetoing events.
   * Added support for passing floating-point numbers to TCallbacks.
   * Modified PaintStage to only repaint the modified parts of the screen.
     This makes REFRESH slightly less likely to overdraw Widgets on the
     stage, but it does not fix the problem entirely.
   * Various bugfixes to wxIE library.
   * Added a function to convert DirtyLists to wxRegions.
   * Added support for opening pages in existing browser widgets from scripts.
   * Added basic support for forward, back, reload and stop buttons.
   * Added support for enabling and disabling forward/back/reload/stop buttons.
   * Fixed bugs which occurred when CLEAR-SCREEN and FILL-BOX were applied
     to transparent overlays with opaque colors.
   * Fixed bug which occurred when PNGs with 1-bit transparency were drawn
     onto transparent overlays.

 Revision 1.54  2004/01/06 19:23:06  emk
 0.0.13 - 6 Jan 2004 - emk

 Basic drag & drop can now be implemented in Scheme.

   * Added support for (SET! (PROP elem name) value) in Scheme.  To support
     this on your templates, you need to implement an
     (ON PROP-CHANGE (name value prev veto) ...) handler.  Be sure to
     CALL-NEXT-HANDLER for properties you don't know about!  This API will
     probably change.
   * SET-ELEMENT-CURSOR! -> (SET! (PROP elem CURSOR) new-value)
   * Made several zone properties setable at runtime.
   * Overlays can now be moved.
   * Overlays no longer need to invalidate themselves when
     deleted--DrawingArea handles this internally.
   * Fixed some text-entry-related bugs.

 Revision 1.53  2004/01/05 20:43:28  emk
 0.0.12 - 5 Jan 2004 - emk

 Graphics-related bug fixes:

   * Fixed bug where PNG's with 1-bit "mask" transparency were accidentally
     made transparent in too many places on 16-bit displays.
   * Fixed bug where opaque overlays with width N (where N*3 is odd) were
     reporting incorrect bmWidthBytes values under Win2K and causing raw
     access to look funny.

 Revision 1.52  2003/12/31 00:33:01  emk
 0.0.11 - 30 Dec 2003 - emk

 TRANSPARENT OVERLAYS!  Added support for alpha-composited layers.  This
 engine will require script updates:

   * SET-ZONE-CURSOR! has been renamed to SET-ELEMENT-CURSOR!.
   * RECT objects now (more) consistently exclude their right and bottom
     edges.  This may cause off-by-one errors in existing drawing code.
   * COLOR now represents opaque alpha values as 255 and transparent values
     as 0.  This is the opposite of the previous behavior.

 Changes to Scheme Runtime:

   * Added :OVERLAY? and :ALPHA? to ZONE.  These allow you to create a
     rectangular zone with an associated drawing context (and optionally an
     alpha channel).  If :OVERLAY? is true, the zone must be rectangular.
   * Added (WITH-DRAWING-CONTEXT ZONE BODY...), which allows you to change
     the current drawing context.  Do not call IDLE within this form.
   * Added (DRAWING-CONTEXT-REXT), which returns the bounding rectangle
     for the current drawing context.
   * Added (COLOR-AT POINT), which returns the color at POINT in the
     current drawing context.
   * Fixed output routines to know about POINT, RECT and COLOR objects.
   * Support for storing POINT, RECT and COLOR objects in engine variables,
     including DEFINE/P.
   * Support for comparing POINT, RECT and COLOR objects with EQUALS?.

 Changes to Tamale:

   * Added an Overlay class.  This is basically a square zone with its
     own (possibly transparent) DrawingArea and special hit-testing logic.
   * Switched from 0 opaque to 255 opaque, for performance and consistency
     with windows.
   * Support for TPoint, TRect, GraphicsTools::Color in engine variables.
   * TRect <-> wxRect conversion functions now reliably exclude right and
     bottom edges.
   * Added CompositeInto functions to Element and DrawingArea, for use with
     alpha-compositing.
   * DrawingAreas may now have alpha-channels.
   * Added alpha-channel support to DrawingArea::Clear.
   * Modified optimized versions of FillBox and DrawPixMap to use a
     templated transfer function, and added a transfer function for using
     them with DrawingAreas with alpha channels.
   * Fixed many bugs with arguments to DrawingArea::InvalidateRect.
   * Added support for retrieving pixel values.
   * Added support for pushing and poping drawing contexts.
   * Implemented a much-more-sophisticated list of dirty regions for use
     with the compositing.
   * Idling not allowed when a drawing context is pushed.
   * Replaced our single offscreen buffer with a compositing pixmap and
     and a background pixmap.
   * Invalidate an element's location when deleting it.

 Changes to wxWindows:

   * Exported AlphaBlend from the MSW wxDC class, so we can do alpha blends
     between arbitrary DCs.
   * Removed wxBitmap::UngetRawData pre-multiplication code--there wasn't
     any matching code in wxBitmap::GetRawData, and many raw algorithms
     are much more efficient on pre-multiplied data.

 Revision 1.51  2003/12/19 19:25:17  emk
 0.0.10 - 19 Dec 2003 - emk

 Lots of work to eliminate all Scheme memory allocation ("consing") while
 idling.  This should fix video performance problems.

   * Added a cache of Scheme "buckets" (variable storage locations) so
     we don't have to allocate memory every time C++ needs to find something
     in the Scheme runtime.
   * Tweaked the idle interface so we don't need to call 'apply'.

 Other changes:

   * Put in some stubs for allowing different font-sizes in edit boxes.

 Revision 1.50  2003/11/17 16:38:15  emk
 0.0.8 - 17 Nov 2003 - emk, brian

   * Added SET-MEDIA-BASE-URL! function.  Pass it either a QuickTime-
     compatible URL or #f (to use the hard drive).
   * Major refactorings of Scheme runtime to help make it testable.
   * Fixed bug where api.ss didn't get recompiled when kernel.ss changed.
   * Split StageFrame out of Stage.
   * Split DrawingArea out of Stage.
   * Reduced coupling between nodes.ss and kernel.ss.
   * Made element deletion the responsibility of Scheme.
   * More work on Geiger audio synth.
   * Turned on QuickTime safe mode to avoid nasty performance problems
     with Boehm.
   * Merged TQTMovie changes from FiveL 3.4.

 Revision 1.49  2003/07/02 17:46:18  emk
 0.0.7 - 2 July 2003 - emk, brian

   * All known audio artifacts in Geiger synth and looping Vorbis
     playback have now been fixed.
   * PARAM renamed to PROP.
   * Major restructuring of template property binding.
   * EVENT-CHARACTER now returns a character, not a string
   * PROP and SEND no longer need their name argument to be quoted
   * Support for screenshots: (SCREENSHOT) will write the current screen
     to a file in the Screenshots directory
   * ON handlers may now return a value
   * Scheme elements don't need to have corresponding C++ elements
   * More or less everything can have an idle handler now
   * Added a MOUSE-MOVED event.
   * New TestCase classes based on xUnit.  These run within the engine.
   * Lots of improvements in build performance.

 Revision 1.48  2003/06/05 00:46:33  emk
 0.0.6 - 4 June 2003 - emk, brian

 Audio work by emk:

   * Mono Vorbis audio supported.
   * Per-channel volume supported.
   * Looping Vorbis audio.
   * Basic real-time Geiger synth implemented.  It still has issues.

 Polygon work by brian:

   * Added support for polygons (POLYGON point ...).
   * Added support for polygonal zones (ZONE name poly callback). Rects
     still work: (ZONE name rect callback) will convert the rect to a
     polygon.
   * Added support for copying polygon definition strings to clipboard
     using crosshair control.

 Revision 1.47  2003/05/30 18:41:01  emk
 0.0.5 - 30 May 2003 - emk

 A very primitive audio layer, with Vorbis support.  I'm making a release so
 the media folks have something to play with.

   * Integrated portaudio audio output library.
   * Integrated libivorbisdec (a.k.a. "Tremor") integerized Ogg Vorbis
     audio decoder.
   * Added new VorbisFile class for loading Ogg Vorbis streams (incomplete).
   * Added new AudioStream class for streaming audio output.
   * Added VorbisAudioStream and SineAudioStream classes.
   * Refactoed IMediaElement interface out of MovieElement.
   * Added AudioStreamElement class.
   * New functions: VORBIS-AUDIO and SINE-WAVE.  These are mostly for
     testing at this point.
   * We no longer drop Vorbis samples during playback (I hope!).

 Revision 1.46  2003/05/28 16:02:46  emk
 0.0.4 - 28 May 2003 - emk, brian

   * Changed CARD syntax to (CARD name () body ...).
   * Allowed GROUP and SEQUENCE to have initialization code:
     (GROUP name () body ...).
   * Can define templates for card groups, cards and elements.
   * Can create temporary elements using CREATE.  These get deleted
     when exiting the card.
   * Can access template parameters directly, or by using PARAM.
   * DRAW-BOX now honors alpha value of color argument.
   * Event handling system moved into kernel.ss and redesigned.
   * Callbacks are now re-entrant.
   * New events: MOUSE-DOWN, MOUSE-UP, MOUSE-ENTER, MOUSE-LEAVE.
   * New functions: MOUSE-GRAB, MOUSE-UNGRAB, MOUSE-GRABBED?.
   * ZONE, MOVIE, HTML and EDIT-BOX now use element templates
     internally.
   * Third-party code with vague or unknown licenses should
     be pulled from the tree.

 Revision 1.45  2003/05/09 17:05:31  emk
   * Very naive implementation of screen resizing--this has no sanity
     checks, no warnings, and probably dies a miserable death if
     multiple monitors are involved.  However, it does fix the bug
     where windows would not be properly centered in full-screen mode.

 Revision 1.44  2003/05/03 19:14:27  emk
 Tamale 0.0.2: Lots of minor new features, including transparency and
 sequences.

 Revision 1.43  2002/11/19 17:50:45  emk
 3.5.11 - Correctly clear resources allocated by a failed attempt to
 load a script before trying to load it again.

 Revision 1.42  2002/11/06 18:29:46  emk
 3.5.10 - 6 Nov 2002 - emk

 wx5L:

 Working on making wx5L portable.  The Windows wx5L build is slightly
 broken; I'll fix it once the portable code is happy.

   * Added FIVEL_NO_MOVIES define to supress use of QuickTime in wx5L builds.
   * Refactored MovieWindow into two classes: MovieWindow, which does
     nothing, and MovieWindowQT which does all the work.  Refer to
     MovieWindowNative to get the right one on a given platform.
   * Wrote scripts to convert *.ico and *.bmp files to *.xpm files.
   * Added AppGraphics.h and AppGraphics.cpp, which import xpm files.
   * Checked in some other utility scripts, and updated 5L-stats.

 Regular 5L:

 Added type information to 5L variables, and replaced (var ...) with a more
 powerful form of (define ...).  These changes should make Scheme more
 pleasant for content authors.

   * TVariable now stores type information.
   * Added SetTyped primitive, and replaced VariableExists with
     VariableInitialized.
   * Added support for "symbol" arguments to primitives.  These correspond
     to Scheme symbols, and should eventually be used when a primitive
     argument refers to a variable name (or one a small, fixed set of strings).
   * Fixed bugs in TVariable's unsigned integer handling.
   * Removed TYPE argument from call-5l-prim, engine-var, etc.
   * Renamed DEFINE-PERSISTENT-VARIABLE to DEFINE/P.
   * Updated fake-engine.ss to mimic new engine, and fixed bug in tool.ss.

 Revision 1.41  2002/10/31 22:58:48  emk
 Edited a comment which prevented GCC from compiling this file.

 Revision 1.40  2002/10/31 18:25:11  emk
 3.5.9 - 31 Oct 2002 - emk

   * New wxWindows front-end now officially added to the build tree.
     This is still massively incomplete, but it's on its way.
   * Lots of compilation flag tweaks, to get all the various Win32 projects
     on the same page re: threads, RTTI, exceptions, etc.
   * CryptTool removed as first step in preparing for open souce release.
     This will simplify our legal issues a bit.
   * Linux build fixes.
   * Fixed bug where MacOS X 5L always played the same video from the CD.
   * Converted all *.rsrc and *.PPob files to *.r files, and included
     instructions on converting them back and forth.  This will allow us
     to play a bit more nicely with CVS, and eliminate all but a few
     files with resource forks from our CVS repository.
   * Source tree re-organization:
     - Common/libs -> libs
     - Common/freetype2 -> libs/freetype2
     - Rename Common/Runtime/5L/ *.ss to have lowercase names
     - Linux, Mac, Win32 build fixes

 Revision 1.39  2002/10/15 18:32:34  emk
 3.5.8 - 15 Oct 2002 - emk

 Engine:

   * The Windows engine now reloads scripts in the same fashion as the
     Mac engine--if a load fails, you get a chance to retry it.
   * Log files get flushed after every line.
   * The LOG and SCHEMEIDLE primitives are no longer logged, to reduce
     clutter in Debug.log.
   * Fixed tons of bugs in places where the Windows engine assumed it
     had a TInterpreter object, but didn't (i.e., lots of "sInstance"
     assertions are gone).
   * Added support for measuring text without drawing it.
   * Added support for checking whether an engine variable is initialized.
   * Made sure LCursor initializes mForceShow.

 Runtime:

   * Support for compiling *.ss files to *.zo files automatically
     (incomplete--it only handles modules loaded with REQUIRE right now).
   * Support for deferring code until the engine is in a safe place to
     run it.  This means that you can call VIDEO, INPUT, etc., from
     within a callback.
   * The syntax of 'for' loops has been simplified.
   * Explicit support for using stylesheets with the INPUT command.
   * Added 'card-exists?' predicate.
   * Fixed bug in 'member?'.
   * Added support for using (var ...) declarations within 'lambda', 'define'
     and 'let'.
   * Added support for initializing engine variables.
   * Made call-5L-prim handle return values of non-string types gracefully.
   * Fixed bugs causing centered and left-aligned text to be measured
     incorrectly.
   * Added a hook system based on Emacs.

 Revision 1.38  2002/10/09 17:34:33  emk
 3.5.7 - 9 Oct 2002 - emk

   * Scheme: Changed 'for-each-item' to 'foreach', and added 'for'.
   * Added extract-docs.pl, which generates HTML manuals.
   * Added many new test cases for the new 5L language.
   * Fixed minor bugs in CryptStream*.*, as discovered by valgrind.
   * All primitives which used to take palette indices now take RGB colors.
   * Old 5L: Added DEFPALETTE command for declaring palettes without
     BMP files.  This provides backwards compatibility for old code.
   * Removed Windows cursor-clipping code because it was occassionally
     immobilizing the cursor completely.

 Revision 1.37  2002/10/03 19:26:10  emk
 Rebuilt Windows engine with MzScheme 202 and cursor fix from 3.4.2.

 Revision 1.36  2002/10/03 02:46:29  emk
 3.5.5 - 1 Oct 2002 - emk

 Preliminary MzScheme support for Macintosh engine.  DO NOT BUILD THE
 NON-CARBON POWERPC BUILD!  WHEN RUN UNDER OS X'S OS 9 EMULATOR, IT WILL
 CORRUPT YOUR OS 9 SYSTEM FILE.

 For legal reasons, this Macintosh engine SHOULD NOT BE DISTRIBUTED outside
 of IML until we do our open source release.  It's statically-linked against
 the LGPL'd MzSchemeLib, which would require us to jump through some
 annoying hoops if we wanted to ship proprietary binaries.

 User-visible changes:

   * This engine supports both legacy 5L and Scheme.
   * No PowerPC build.
   * No more start scripts.  Move everything into your main script.
   * No more switching between scripts.
   * CD ejection and fades are gone, thanks to the fact this build is
     Carbon-only.

 Engine changes:

   * Created CodeWarrior project for MzSchemeLib, to avoid the pay-per-view
     cage match between MPW StdCLib and Metrowerks Standard Library over
     who's going to link with what.
   * Fixed MzScheme's call to PBGetCatInfo to work under Carbon.
   * Added code to explicitly set Boehm GC stack base on the Macintosh.
     Boehm can't figure this out without help, and will crash on startup.
   * Namespace fixes to make things compile on the Mac.
   * Made a mess of the MzSchemeLib MPW build infrastructure trying to get
     things to work.  I'm checking in my hacked-up version because (1) it
     marginally works and (2) we might need it again someday.
   * Removed a number of unused files with licensing problems, and sorted
     the rest of the problematic files into categories.
   * Changed event-handling model to give the TInterpreterManager object control,
     instead of the traditional PowerPlant::LApplication::Run method.  This
     requires us to roll our own version of Run and do some tricky event
     handling in CMac5LApp::MacIdleProc.  But it also means the Mac engine
     now supports arbitrary interpreters.  This change has lots of
     consequences, most of them complicated--and it may affect stability.
   * CPlayerView is now more careful about checking whether a TInterpreter
     object actually exists before calling methods on it.
   * Renamed MakeNewIndex methods to ProcessTopLevelForm.
   * Moved all old5l-related files into Mac/Source/lang/old5l.
   * Moved interpreter-managing code into TMac5LInterpreter.{h,cpp}.
   * Moved file-related primitives into TMac5LPrimitives.cpp.
   * Shift-scripts are gone.
   * Ripped out support for switching scripts.
   * Reimplemented script reloading, exiting, etc., using the
     TInterpreterManager interface.
   * Lots of changes to the Macintosh project files.
   * Updated Windows interpreter to newest MzScheme release.
   * Fixed the Linux build.

 Headers (and therefore text input) are only available to the old 5L
 language.  This will change soon.

 Revision 1.35  2002/08/22 00:12:05  emk
 3.5.4 - 21 Aug 2002 - emk

 Engine:

   * Moved many source files from Common to Common/lang/old5L, and from
     Win32/FiveL to Win32/FiveL/lang/old5l, including the index system, the
     parser and stream classes, the crypto classes and the file I/O classes.
   * Broke the dependencies between Header and TIndex, in a fashion similar
     to what I did for TStyleSheet in 3.5.1.  This means we can call
     INPUT from Scheme, which more-or-less completes the Scheme primitives.
   * Made sure that header and stylesheet names were case insensitive.

 Revision 1.34  2002/08/19 22:31:48  emk
 3.5.3 - 18 Aug 2002 - emk

 Changes to support the rapidly-growing test suites.

 Engine:

   * Renamed _error variable to _errorcode to avoid conflicting with the
     _error variable used by the 'video' command (which we'll probably
     need to clean up sometime, but that's life).  This will affect
     scripts which call the BROWSE command, but not much else.

 Runtime:

   * Implemented DEFINE-ENGINE-VARIABLE, which provides transparent
     binding between Scheme and 5L variables.
   * Added *TEXT-X*, *TEXT-Y*, *GRAPHIC-X* and *GRAPHIC-Y* variables,
     which are bound to _INCR_X, INCR_Y, _Graphic_X and _Graphic_Y.
   * Added WHILE and FOR-EACH-ITEM loops.
   * Added HAVE-5L-PRIM? and REFRESH functions.
   * Modified JUMP function to use JUMP primitive when available, so video
     gets killed when jumping between cards.
   * Refresh the screen at the end of each card.

 Revision 1.33  2002/08/19 17:27:28  emk
 3.5.2 - 18 Aug 2002 - emk

   * Modified the TSchemeInterpreter class to make intelligent use of
     namespaces and modules.
   * Fully modularized the runtime, and made the lispish language extensions
     available.  The "lispish" code currently belongs to me (and is released
     under the LGPL), but I'll be happy to relicense it to the Trustees.
   * Got redoscript to work--we no longer attempt to restart the entire
     Scheme interpreter; we merely throw away a sandbox.
   * Moved the code for resetting stylesheets out of the TWin5LInterpreter
     and into the main Win32 engine.

 Revision 1.32  2002/08/17 01:41:55  emk
 3.5.1 - 16 Aug 2002 - emk

 Added support for defining stylesheets in Scheme.  This means that Scheme
 can draw text!  (The INPUT doesn't work yet, because this relies on the
 separate, not-yet-fixed header system.)  This involved lots of refactoring.

   * Created TTopLevelFormProcessor as an abstract superclass of
     TIndexManager, and modified TParser to use TTopLevelFormProcessor.
     This allows the legacy 5L language to contain non-TIndex tlfs.
   * Implemented a TPrimitiveTlfProcessor class, which allows
     top-level-forms to be implemented as calls to regular 5L primitives.
   * Yanked our ValueOrPercent support from TStream into the
     TArgumentList superclass, and implemented it for all TArgumentList
     subclasses.  This allows non-5L languages to specify the funky
     percentage arguments used by the DEFSTYLE command.
   * Removed all TIndex/TIndexManager support from TStyleSheet, and
     reimplemented it using an STL std::map.  This breaks the dependencies
     between stylesheets and the old 5L interpreter.
   * Implemented a DEFSTYLE primitive.

 Revision 1.31  2002/08/16 16:26:22  emk
 3.5.0 - 16 Aug 2002 - emk, zeb

 Preliminary Scheme support for Windows.  The Macintosh build is broken
 until Brian updates the event loop to use a TInterpreterManager object
 and figures out how to get the mzscheme libraries building.

 Ported 3.4.1 changes forward to Windows.

 Revision 1.30.2.1  2002/08/14 20:24:49  emk
 Language bugfixes/enhancements/changes for HIV Prevention Counseling.  I
 removed some deeply-buried bugs in TStream and elsewhere, so please test
 this build thoroughly.

   * New entities: &shy;, &nbsp;, and &radic;.  I've also added
     &check; and &cross;, but we don't have the necessary font support yet.
   * TStream now handles whitespace rationally.  String literals are
     parsed verbatim, and the old "randomly munge whitespace" behavior
     has been fixed.  Most of the other changes are necessary consequences
     of this change.
   * Verbatim CR, LF and TAB characters in strings will be passed through.
     This may affect screen layout.
   * The (get ...) primitive has been backported from 3.5.
   * The '&' syntax has been removed.  Instead of '&foo$bar', you should
     now write '$(get foo$bar)'.
   * Entities don't need to be escaped any more: \&amp; -> &amp;.

 Thanks to this cleanup, it was possible to implement several much-wanted
 features without too much work:

   * New primitives: WHEN, UNLESS and WHILE.
   * BODY has been renamed to BEGIN, and longer prematurely evaluates all
     the variables in nested expressions.
   * Debug log improvements.

 Revision 1.30  2002/07/26 20:10:22  emk
 (Updating the *rest* of the version numbers.  Ooops.)

 Revision 1.29  2002/07/26 20:07:39  emk
 3.4.0 - 26 July 2002 - emk

   * Updated version numbers for official stable release!

 Revision 1.28  2002/07/26 20:00:15  zeb
 3.3.21 - 26 July 2002 - zeb

   * Added FileSystem::ExistenceCheck, which we use to check for the
     existence of various files during the startup process (bug #937).

 Revision 1.27  2002/07/26 17:55:10  emk
 3.3.20 - 26 July 2002 - emk

 A QA binge, thanks to RedHat's memprof, Bruce Perens' Electric Fence,
 and Rational's Purify.

   * Linux build fixes so I can run memprof and Electric Fence.
   * Fixed a bug in TStream::GetStringArg when called on an empty stream.
     This is probably why we were seeing weird results when CHeader called
     TStream::more() too many times.
   * Fixed a buffer-overflow bug in TLogger when logging large messages.
   * Squashed a bunch of memory leaks in CryptStream.cpp.
   * Made new CryptStream auto_ptr code work under Windows.
   * PURIFY: Fixed memory leak in TBTree::Add of duplicate node.  We now
     notify the user if there are duplicate cards, macros, etc.
   * PURIFY: Fixed memory leak in TBTree destructor.
   * PURIFY: Fixed memory leak in ConfigManager destructor.
   * PURIFY: Fixed memory leaks when deleting DIBs.
   * PURIFY: Made sure we deleted offscreen GWorld when exiting.
   * PURIFY: Fixed memory leak in LBrowser.
   * PURIFY: Fixed memory leak in LFileBundle.
   * PURIFY: Fixed uninitialized memory reads when View methods were
     called before View::Init.
   * PURIFY: Made View::Draw a no-op before View::Init is called.
     (It seems that Windows causes us to call Draw too early.)
   * Added TOUCHCOUNT, TOUCHCOORDS and TOUCHACTIVATE commands so Douglas
     can build an automatic test monkey.  These are Win32-only, because
     the Mac touchzone system needs an overhaul and I don't want to
     mess with it right now (#1076).
   * Added StValueRestorer<> template class which can save and restore
     the values of variables in an exception-safe fashion.
   * Began code audit for exception safety (bug #1074).

 Revision 1.26  2002/07/24 17:41:02  emk
 3.3.19 - 24 July 2002 - emk

   * Cleaned up Win32 5L.log (bug #1057).
   * We now print the glyph cache size every 100K (bug #969).

 Revision 1.25  2002/07/24 01:16:43  emk
 3.3.18 - 23 July 2002 - emk

   * Forward-ported QtComponentVersion to the Mac (bug #1054).
   * Fixed redoscript/keybind race condition (bug #1036).
   * Added a top-level try/catch block on the Mac (bug #955).
   * Added error checking in Mac BROWSE (bug #1070).
   * Enlarged our growzone a bit, and made sure it's working.
     This will help us determine if we have memory usage problems.

 Revision 1.24  2002/07/23 21:53:41  emk
 3.3.17 - 23 July 2002 - emk

   * Fixed RETURN in macros (bug #1053).
   * Fixed typography exception when missing buttpcx graphic (bug #1039).
   * Made Win32 BROWSE return an error if it fails (bug #793).
   * Forward-ported QtComponentVersion to Win32 (bug #1054).
   * Performance tuned Win32 textaa (bug #933).

 Revision 1.23  2002/07/19 21:17:47  emk
 * Fixed "b" parameter to defstyle (bug #1052).
 * Fixed Mac engine to log missing macros to Debug.log (bug #1060).

 Revision 1.22  2002/07/17 16:06:48  brian
 3.3.15 - 17 July 2002 - brian

   * Fixed excessive error messages for missing button graphics (#1039).
   * This bug might still occur on Windows; it needs to be looked into.

 Revision 1.21  2002/07/15 18:11:31  brian
 3.3.14 - 15 July 2002 - brian, emk

   * Fixed GWorld flashing (bug #930).
   * Windows 3.3.13 fixes ported to the Macintosh.

 (emk, checking in from Brian's account after finishing some
 bug-stomping for him)

 Revision 1.20  2002/07/15 15:56:32  zeb
 3.3.13 - 15 July 2002 - zeb, emk
   * Language change: (IF cond true_cmd false_cmd) now takes arbitrary
     expressions for 'cond'.  The following new primitives have
     been added: AND, OR, NOT, contains, =, <>, <, >, <=, >=.
   * Added a new (LOG filename msg) command, which allows the programmer
     to write to "5L", "debug" and "MissingMedia" logs.
   * Major logging improvements: All primitives are now automatically
     logged in a standard format (bug #1003).
   * Adjusting of coordinates using origin is now logged.
   * Callbacks are now logged in a much more useful fashion.
   * Old arithmetic primitives now return a value (add, sub, div).
   * Added MakeQuotedString to TTemplateUtils and wrote a matching test suite.

 Revision 1.19  2002/07/10 15:21:33  brian
 3.3.12 - Improved debug.log for text and textaa commands (bug #979).

 Revision 1.18  2002/07/08 16:43:46  emk
 3.3.11 - Bugfixes from 3.2.0.5 through 3.2.0.7.

   * Ported Win32 QuickTime 6/VP3 bugfix forward from 3.2.0.x.
   * Ported Win32 QuickTime 6 gamma bugfix forward from 3.2.0.x.
   * Ported Win32 line drawing bugfix forward from 3.2.0.x.
   * Fixed Win32 (touch ...) command to highlight touchzones more like the
     Macintosh.  (It now redraws the unhighlighted graphic at the end of the
     highlight sequence.)

 Revision 1.17  2002/07/08 14:25:33  zeb
 3.3.10 - 7 July 2002

   * Added a new Release-Notes.txt file.
   * Fixed a bug which caused LFileBundle to die with an assertion
     failure when importing an empty file.
   * New feature: Modulo primitive.  5L now supports Modulo(x,y).
     Syntax is (% x y).

 Revision 1.16  2002/06/24 15:17:11  emk
 3.3.9 - Highly experimental engine which makes _INCR_X,
 _INCR_Y, _Graphic_X and _Graphic_Y relative to the current
 origin.   This will break macros in existing code!

 Revision 1.15  2002/06/21 15:41:58  emk
 3.3.8 - 5L language improvements, including nested expressions,
 return values and new primitives.

   * Expressions can now be nested: '(set x $(+ 2 $(* 3 5)))' will
     set 'x' to 17.  Nested expressions should be indented as follows:

       (set x $(+ $really_big_variable_1
                  $really_big_variable_2))

     ...that is, arguments should _stack in a column_.  I will be
     extremely anal about this if I'm reading your code.

   * '(return ...)' now takes an optional argument, which will be
     returned from the macro.  So you can define your own functions, too.

   * New primitives: +, -, *, /, truncate, float+, float-, float*,
     float/, strlen, substr, findsubstr, length, nth, haskey, getval.

 A note on Lisp naming conventions--when you create a new "data structure"
 type, you should generally name functions as follows:

   # Define a type 'pt' with members 'x' and 'y' using lists.
   (macrodef pt (return ($1 $2)))
   (macrodef pt-x (return $(nth 0 $1)))
   (macrodef pt-y (return $(nth 1 $1)))

   # Alternative implementation of a type 'pt2' using associative lists.
   # (You couldn't pass 'pt2' to a built-in command, but it's a nice small
   # example.)
   (macrodef pt2 (return (x $1 y $2)))      # (pt2 10 20) => (x 10 y 20)
   (macrodef pt2-x (return $(getval $1 x))) # (pt2-x ...) => 10
   (macrodef pt2-y (return $(getval $1 y))) # (pt2-y ...) => 20

 The function 'pt' is called the "constructor", and the functions 'pt-x' and
 'pt-y' are called "accessors".

 Revision 1.14  2002/06/20 21:01:48  emk
 3.3.7 - Debug log updates, and error message if 5L is run without
 Mac5L.config or other support files.

 Revision 1.13  2002/06/20 19:49:57  emk
 3.3.6 - Fixed problems with BUTTPCX (and other?) highlighting.

 Revision 1.12  2002/06/20 16:31:00  emk
 3.3.5 - Merged the 'FiveL_3_3_4_refactor_lang_1' branch back into the trunk.
 This branch contained the following enhancements:

   * Most of the communication between the interpreter and the
     engine now goes through the interfaces defined in
     TInterpreter.h and TPrimitive.h.  Among other things, this
     refactoring makes will make it easier to (1) change the interpreter
     from 5L to Scheme and (2) add portable primitives that work
     the same on both platforms.
   * A new system for handling callbacks.

 I also slipped in the following, unrelated enhancements:

   * MacOS X fixes.  Classic Mac5L once again runs under OS X, and
     there is a new, not-yet-ready-for-prime-time Carbonized build.
   * Bug fixes from the "Fix for 3.4" list.

 Revision 1.11.2.11  2002/06/20 15:58:44  emk
 3.3.4.12 - Last build of the 'FiveL_3_3_4_refactor_lang_1' branch
 before merging.

 Revision 1.11.2.10  2002/06/19 22:50:55  emk
 3.3.4.11 - Refactored Mac code to move primitives from CCard.{h,cpp} to
 TMacPrimitives.{h,cpp}, and break most of the remaining dependencies on
 the 5L interpreter.

 Language changes: LOADPICK, RVAR and RNODE are gone.  I've also disabled
 the Mac PAUSE command until Douglas tells me how it should work.

 Testing: Please beat *very* hard on this build, and pay special attention
 to WAIT, NAP, TIMEOUT, and similar commands.

 Next up: I plan to merge this branch into HEAD tomorrow.

 Revision 1.11.2.9  2002/06/19 18:28:47  emk
 3.3.4.10 - Debug log message improvements on the Mac.

 Revision 1.11.2.8  2002/06/19 14:07:13  emk
 3.3.4.9: Fixed _Origin_X, _Origin_Y on Windows, and added a "default style"
 parameter to "defstyle" on both platforms.

 The new syntax:

   (defstyle sample (Nimbus Roman No9 L) 12 r left 0xF0F0F000 0xFFFF0000)

 ...where r = "regular", b = "bold", i = "italic" and bi = "bold italic".

 Revision 1.11.2.7  2002/06/18 21:56:38  emk
 3.3.4.8 - Added (BODY ...) command on Mac, fixed arguments of BUTTPCX, TOUCH,
 and KEYBIND to match Win32 engine, and refactored Mac engine to more-or-less
 respect the TInterpreter interface.

 Things to test: REDOSCRIPT, redo-REDOSCRIPT (feed REDOSCRIPT a bogus script,
 try to fix it, then run REDOSCRIPT again), TOUCH, BUTTPCX, ORIGIN.

 Some low-level details:

   - Added a KillCurrentCard method to the TInterpreter interface.  This
     works a lot like Pause, but it cannot be resumed.
   - Added a rough-cut TMac5LInterpreter class (with some methods stubbed
     out, because they are not needed on the Mac--we should look at
     this API in detail and formalize it sometime after 3.4).
   - Modified CTouchZone to take TCallback objects.
   - Modified CPlayerView's keybinding support to take TCallback objects
     (and to use a std::map instead of a PowerPlant list class).
   - Began to separate special forms (IF, BODY, EXIT, RETURN) from other
     commands.
   - Moved ReadSpecialVariable_* methods out of CCard and into CMac5LApp.
   - Made sure CMac5LApp::mReDoReDo got initialized to false.
   - Merged OpenScript and OpenScriptAgain into one function.

 Revision 1.11.2.6  2002/06/15 01:06:32  emk
 3.3.4.7 - Carbonization of Mac build, support for running non-Carbonized build
 in MacOS X's OS 9 emulator, and basic support for 5L.prefs on the Mac.  The
 Carbon build isn't yet ready for prime time--see BugHunt for details--but it
 is good enough to use for engine development.

 * Language changes

   - CHECKDISC is gone; use CHECKVOL instead.
   - EJECT is disabled in the Carbon build, because Carbon has no way to
     identify CD drives reliably.  EJECT still works in the regular build.
   - Gamma fades are ignored in the Carbon build.
   - KEYBINDs must now be accessed with the Command key only--not Option.

 * Things to test

 Please be hugely brutal to 5L; this is a big update.

   - 8-bit systems, palettes, ORIGIN, EJECT on the non-Carbon build.

 * Internal changes

   - TException class (and all subclasses) now take a __FILE__ and __LINE__
     parameter.  This is ugly, but it allows me to debug 5L exceptions even
     without a working debugger (under the OS 9 emulator, for example).
   - FileSystem::Path::(DoesExist|IsRegularFile|IsDirectory) now rely on
     native MacOS File Manager calls instead of the broken MSL stat()
     function (which fails in the OS 9 emulator).
   - The ImlUnit test harness flushes its output more often.
   - Many data structure accessors (and such functions as c2pstr) have been
     replaced by their Carbon equivalents.
   - We now use PowerPlant accessors to get at the QuickDraw globals.
   - We now use PowerPlant calls in place of ValidRect and InvalRect.
   - Some very nasty code which set the palettes of our offscreen GWorlds
     has been removed (offscreen GWorlds have CLUTs, not palettes!).
     The various drawing commands now use gPaletteManager to map indexes
     to RGBColor values, and RGBForeColor to set the color--no more calls
     to ::PmForeColor on offscreen GWorlds, thank you!
   - The CMenuUtil code (which used low-memory system globals to hide
     and show the menu bar) has been removed entirely and replaced by
     calls to HideMenuBar and ShowMenuBar (which are present in 8.5 and
     Carbon).  This is much simpler, nicer, more portable and safer.
   - A bunch of code which had been disabled with #ifdefs has been
     removed entirely.  This mostly related to palettes and an obsolete
     version of the fade code which used GWorlds.
   - Code which used ROM-based KCHR resources to map option keys back to
     their unmodified key caps has been removed.  This means KEYBINDs
     can only be accessed using the Command key.
   - We assume Carbon systems always support the HFS file system (duh).
   - We use PowerPlant glue to access either StandardFile or Navigation
     Services, under OS 8/9 and Carbon, respectively.
   - Some old subroutines in CModuleManager appeared to have been
     snarfed from More Files, an old Mac utility library.  These have
     been moved into MoreFiles.{h,cpp}.

 * Known Carbon Problems

 Fades, ejecting CD-ROMs and playing QuickTime movies are all broken in
 the Carbon build.  Douglas has found a problem with ORIGIN.  It looks
 like we should continue to ship the OS 9 build for use with MacOS X,
 at least for next few months.

 Revision 1.11.2.5  2002/06/12 19:42:36  emk
 3.3.4.6 - Fixed bug where the origin didn't get restored after each macro
 call.  (This bug was introduced in 3.3.4.5.)

 Revision 1.11.2.4  2002/06/12 19:02:51  emk
 3.3.4.5 - Moved Do* commands from Card.{h,cpp} to TWinPrimitives.{h,cpp},
 and broke the remaining dependencies between these primitive commands and
 the current 5L interpreter.  The TInterpreter and TPrimitives interfaces
 are now quite mature.

 *** Please beat very, very hard on this build.  I don't anticipate
 further changes to the Windows engine for a while. ***

 REMOVED COMMANDS: kill (use still), loadpick (use loadpic)
 NEEDS TESTING: origin w/macros, other uses of origin.  5L now
   sets the origin to 0,0 whenever it begins a new card, which
   should produce behavior identical to the old system, unless
   I've overlooked something.
 NEEDS TESTING: make sure all the commands are available, and
   have the right names.  I've checked this a dozen times
   by eye, but I might have overlooked something.

 The only remaining dependencies between the interpreter and the rest of 5L
 are in the Header and TStyleSheet classes.  I'm postponing this last bit
 of cleanup until after 3.4.  Up next: Repeat the 3.3.4.{1-5} changes for
 the Macintosh.

 Revision 1.11.2.3  2002/06/11 18:15:31  emk
 3.3.4.4 - Partial separation of primitives from interpreter, and
 various 5L language enhancements related to callbacks.

   - Finished fleshing out TArgumentList, added support for callbacks.
   - Made all built-in primitives access their arguments through the
     TArgument interface.
   - Implemented a BODY command.
   - Changed how the TOUCH, BUTTPCX and KEYBIND commands parse their
     callback arguments.  See below for details; you'll have to change
     some code.  This was necessary to move callback parsing into
     TStream's implementation of the TArgumentList interface.

 5L Language Changes
 -------------------

   * (KEYBIND ...) now takes an arbitrary command instead of a card name.
     As with TOUCH and BUTTPCX, variables are evaluated when the
     keybind is installed, not when it is invoked.  Examples:

       (keybind f (jump foo))
       (keybind a (add x 10))

   * You can now run a series of zero or more commands using (BODY cmd...).
     This should work with IF, TOUCH, BUTTPCX and KEYBIND.  Example:

       (body
         (set x 10)
         (set y 20))

     Commands such as WAIT, JUMP, NAP, etc., will not do what you expect
     unless they're the last statement in a BODY.  This is caused by the
     low-level design of the interpreter, and is non-trivial to fix.

     RETURN is also not BODY-friendly.

     When you pass a body to IF, TOUCH, BUTTPCX or KEYBIND, all the
     variables in the body will be evaluated *before* any code is run!

   * The arguments to BUTTPCX and TOUCH have been rationalized after
     consultation with Douglas.  The commands now work as follows:

       (TOUCH rect cmd [cursor [picture [point]]])
       (BUTTPCX picture point header label cmd [cursor])

     Note that the second callback has disappeared from both TOUCH and
     BUTTPCX; use BODY instead.

 Revision 1.11.2.2  2002/06/10 17:52:48  emk
 3.3.4.3 - Added a TArgumentList class in TPrimitives.  This class provides
 an abstract interface to argument list parsing, and replaces parts of
 TStream.  This will allow us to begin breaking dependencies between
 the primitives and the nasty parsing gunk in TStream.

 Revision 1.11.2.1  2002/06/05 20:42:29  emk
 3.3.4.2 - Broke Win5L dependencies on TIndex file by moving various pieces
 of code into TWin5LInterpreter.  Windows 5L now accesses the interpreter
 through a well-defined API.  Changes:

   * Removed many direct and indirect #includes of TIndex.h.
   * Added a TInterpreter method ReloadScript, which can be called by the
     higher-level ReDoScript command.
   * Checked in some files which should have been included in the 3.3.4.1
     checkin--these files contain the initial refactorings of Card and Macro
     callsites to go through the TInterpreter interface.

 Up next: Refactor various Do* methods out of Card and into a procedural
 database.

 Revision 1.11  2002/05/29 13:58:10  emk
 3.3.4 - Fixed various crash-on-exit problems (including those in TBTree,
 TIndex and TLogger::FatalError), and reverted the Win32 _INCR_Y code
 to the behavior that shipped with Genetics.

 Revision 1.10  2002/05/15 11:05:18  emk
 3.3.3 - Merged in changes from FiveL_3_3_2_emk_typography_merge branch.
 Synopsis: The Common code is now up to 20Kloc, anti-aliased typography
 is available, and several subsystems have been refactored.  For more
 detailed descriptions, see the CVS branch.

 The merged Mac code hasn't been built yet; I'll take care of that next.

 Revision 1.9.2.9  2002/05/01 11:34:02  emk
 Added support for passing a "(pcent ...)" argument to "defstyle" to
 specify leading as a percentage of the base font size (and cleaned up
 a few minor test suite issues).

 Revision 1.9.2.8  2002/05/01 07:10:49  emk
 3.3.2.7 - Fixed assertion failure on "Special Variables" screen, fixed
 missing bullets, and added "\&Delta;" and "\&delta;" entities for
 use with the (textaa ...) command only.

 Revision 1.9.2.7  2002/05/01 03:27:02  emk
 3.3.2.6 - First Windows engine with (textaa ...) command.

 - Implemented a primitive, slow Image::DrawPixMap command that uses
 ::GetPixel and ::SetPixel to do alpha blending (shudder).  Strangely
 enough, it's about as fast as the somewhat optimized Mac routines.
 Anyone got a good GDI book?

 - Fixed several assertion failures.

 Known problems:

 - Occasional assertion failure on exit.  The reference-counting on
 TIndexFile claims it's getting dereferenced too many times.  This is
 an old bug; all the TBTree and TBNode classes are pretty dodgy.

 - Assertion failure on "Special Variables" screen in 5Ltest.  This is
 caused by overlong lines.

 Revision 1.9.2.6  2002/04/30 07:57:24  emk
 3.3.2.5 - Port Win32 code to use the 20Kloc of Common code that now
 exists.  The (defstyle ...) command should work, but (textaa ...) isn't
 available yet.

 Next up: Implement the (textaa ...) command and the low-level
 GraphicsTools::Image::DrawBitMap.

 Revision 1.9.2.5  2002/04/29 06:29:58  emk
 3.3.2.4 - Contains first set of performance tweaks, and fixes problem with assertion failures after reload and on CME screens.

 Revision 1.9.2.4  2002/04/26 11:31:01  emk
 3.3.2.3 - Fixed highlight shadow color to default to regular shadow color (instead of highlight color, which is obviously wrong).

 Revision 1.9.2.3  2002/04/26 08:51:21  emk
 3.3.2.2 - First experimental engine with (textaa ...) and (defstyle ...) commands.

 Changes:

   - Ported new TEncoding template class to the Mac.

   - Updated TStyleSheet to provide bug-for-bug compatibility with the way backslashed escaped sequences are processed.

 Revision 1.9.2.2  2002/04/23 11:29:47  emk
 Prepended "VERSION_" to the version-related preprocessor defines, because this way is (1) nicer and (2) matches the Mac engine's preprocessor defines.

 Revision 1.9.2.1  2002/04/19 11:20:13  emk
 Start of the heavy typography merging work.  I'm doing this on a branch
 so I don't cause problems for any of the other developers.

 Alpha-blend text colors.

 Merged Mac and Windows versions of several files into the Common directory.
 Not all of these work on Mac and/or Windows yet, but they're getting there.
 Primary sources for the merged code are:

   Win/FiveL/LVersion.h -> Common/TVersion.h
   Win/FiveL/LStream.h -> Common/TStream.h
   Mac/Source/CStream.cp -> Common/TStream.cpp
   Mac/Source/CStreamTests.cp -> Common/TStreamTests.cpp

 TStream changes:

   * The TStream code now uses a callback to variable values.  This will
     probably go away once Variable and CVariable get merged.
   * Input operators for std::string and GraphicTools::Color.

 Isolated Windows-specific code in TLogger.*, in preparation for a big merge.

   * Added a portable function to set up logging.
   * Fixed the logging code to use the portable FileSystem library.
   * Made FatalError actually quit the application.

 Turned off the FiveL namespace on FIVEL_PLATFORM_OTHER, so we can debug
 with GDB, which has a few minor but painful namespace issues.

 TString changes:

   * Made sure we can convert from std::string to a TString.
   * Added some more assertions.
   * Fixed bug in various operator= methods which would allow the string's
     internal data pointer to be NULL.
   * Changed operator[] and operator() arguments to be 'int' instead of
     'int32' to avoid nasty compiler warnings.

 Typography::Style changes:

   * Added a "ShadowOffset" field that specifies the offset of the
     drop shadow.
   * Added an operator== for testing.
   * Added a ToggleFaceStyle method for toggling specified face style bits.

 Typography::StyledText changes:

   * Added a method to append a single character.

 Other Typography changes:

   * Made FaceStyle an int, not an enum, so we can do bit math with it.
   * Added assertions to made sure you can't extract a StyledText iterator
     until you've called EndConstruction.

 Revision 1.9  2002/04/19 10:21:52  hyjin
 Added support for a movie controller in 5L applications, and deleted some buggy pre-roll code that appeared to be causing crashes.  We're not a hundred percent sure all the crashing problems are fixed, but things seem to be working very well.  Please test this extensively!

 Set global variable _bShowMC to see the movie controller (case insensitive).

 Changes by Yijin, reviewed by Eric Kidd.

 Revision 1.8  2002/04/19 06:02:57  emk
 Merged in MD5-replacement changes from 3.2.0.4.

 This code will become 3.3.1.  PLEASE USE THIS VERSION IN PREFERENCE TO THE 3.3.0
 OR OLDER BINARIES, WHICH THE FSF's LEGAL COUNCIL HAS ASKED US NOT TO SHIP.

 Revision 1.7  2002/03/29 11:14:42  emk
 Final Win32 fixes for 3.3.0 development release.

 Revision 1.6  2002/02/27 13:21:12  tvw
 Bug #613 - Changed calculation of _INCR_Y to include descenders
 (part or letter that goes below baseline).

 Revision 1.5  2002/02/19 12:35:12  tvw
 Bugs #494 and #495 are addressed in this update.

 (1) 5L.prefs configuration file introduced
 (2) 5L_d.exe will no longer be part of CVS codebase, 5L.prefs allows for
     running in different modes.
 (3) Dozens of compile-time switches were removed in favor of
     having a single executable and parameters in the 5L.prefs file.
 (4) CryptStream was updated to support encrypting/decrypting any file.
 (5) Clear file streaming is no longer supported by CryptStream

 For more details, refer to ReleaseNotes.txt

 Revision 1.4  2002/02/19 11:41:38  tvw
 Merged from branch FiveL_3_1_1_Stabilization

 Revision 1.3.2.1  2002/02/19 10:20:23  tvw
 Stable build v3.2.0 (based on v3.1.1)

 Revision 1.3  2002/01/24 19:22:41  tvw
 Fixed bug (#531) in -D command-line option causing
 system registry read error.

 Revision 1.2  2002/01/23 20:39:20  tvw
 A group of changes to support a new stable build.

 (1) Only a single instance of the FiveL executable may run.

 (2) New command-line option "-D" used to lookup the installation directory in the system registry.
     Note: Underscores will be parsed as spaces(" ").
     Ex: FiveL -D HIV_Prevention_Counseling

 (3) Slow down the flash on buttpcx so it can be seen on
     fast machines.  A 200 mS pause was added.

 (4) Several bugfixes to prevent possible crashes when error
     conditions occur.
