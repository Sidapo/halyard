 Revision 1.11.2.3  2002/06/11 18:15:31  emk
 3.3.4.4 - Partial separation of primitives from interpreter, and
 various 5L language enhancements related to callbacks.

   - Finished fleshing out TArgumentList, added support for callbacks.
   - Made all built-in primitives access their arguments through the
     TArgument interface.
   - Implemented a BODY command.
   - Changed how the TOUCH, BUTTPCX and KEYBIND commands parse their
     callback arguments.  See below for details; you'll have to change
     some code.  This was necessary to move callback parsing into
     TStream's implementation of the TArgumentList interface.

 5L Language Changes
 -------------------

   * (KEYBIND ...) now takes an arbitrary command instead of a card name.
     As with TOUCH and BUTTPCX, variables are evaluated when the
     keybind is installed, not when it is invoked.  Examples:

       (keybind f (jump foo))
       (keybind a (add x 10))

   * You can now run a series of zero or more commands using (BODY cmd...).
     This should work with IF, TOUCH, BUTTPCX and KEYBIND.  Example:

       (body
         (set x 10)
         (set y 20))

     Commands such as WAIT, JUMP, NAP, etc., will not do what you expect
     unless they're the last statement in a BODY.  This is caused by the
     low-level design of the interpreter, and is non-trivial to fix.

     RETURN is also not BODY-friendly.

     When you pass a body to IF, TOUCH, BUTTPCX or KEYBIND, all the
     variables in the body will be evaluated *before* any code is run!

   * The arguments to BUTTPCX and TOUCH have been rationalized after
     consultation with Douglas.  The commands now work as follows:

       (TOUCH rect cmd [cursor [picture [point]]])
       (BUTTPCX picture point header label cmd [cursor])

     Note that the second callback has disappeared from both TOUCH and
     BUTTPCX; use BODY instead.

 Revision 1.11.2.2  2002/06/10 17:52:48  emk
 3.3.4.3 - Added a TArgumentList class in TPrimitives.  This class provides
 an abstract interface to argument list parsing, and replaces parts of
 TStream.  This will allow us to begin breaking dependencies between
 the primitives and the nasty parsing gunk in TStream.

 Revision 1.11.2.1  2002/06/05 20:42:29  emk
 3.3.4.2 - Broke Win5L dependencies on TIndex file by moving various pieces
 of code into TWin5LInterpreter.  Windows 5L now accesses the interpreter
 through a well-defined API.  Changes:

   * Removed many direct and indirect #includes of TIndex.h.
   * Added a TInterpreter method ReloadScript, which can be called by the
     higher-level ReDoScript command.
   * Checked in some files which should have been included in the 3.3.4.1
     checkin--these files contain the initial refactorings of Card and Macro
     callsites to go through the TInterpreter interface.

 Up next: Refactor various Do* methods out of Card and into a procedural
 database.

 Revision 1.11  2002/05/29 13:58:10  emk
 3.3.4 - Fixed various crash-on-exit problems (including those in TBTree,
 TIndex and TLogger::FatalError), and reverted the Win32 _INCR_Y code
 to the behavior that shipped with Genetics.

 Revision 1.10  2002/05/15 11:05:18  emk
 3.3.3 - Merged in changes from FiveL_3_3_2_emk_typography_merge branch.
 Synopsis: The Common code is now up to 20Kloc, anti-aliased typography
 is available, and several subsystems have been refactored.  For more
 detailed descriptions, see the CVS branch.

 The merged Mac code hasn't been built yet; I'll take care of that next.

 Revision 1.9.2.9  2002/05/01 11:34:02  emk
 Added support for passing a "(pcent ...)" argument to "defstyle" to
 specify leading as a percentage of the base font size (and cleaned up
 a few minor test suite issues).

 Revision 1.9.2.8  2002/05/01 07:10:49  emk
 3.3.2.7 - Fixed assertion failure on "Special Variables" screen, fixed
 missing bullets, and added "\&Delta;" and "\&delta;" entities for
 use with the (textaa ...) command only.

 Revision 1.9.2.7  2002/05/01 03:27:02  emk
 3.3.2.6 - First Windows engine with (textaa ...) command.

 - Implemented a primitive, slow Image::DrawPixMap command that uses
 ::GetPixel and ::SetPixel to do alpha blending (shudder).  Strangely
 enough, it's about as fast as the somewhat optimized Mac routines.
 Anyone got a good GDI book?

 - Fixed several assertion failures.

 Known problems:

 - Occasional assertion failure on exit.  The reference-counting on
 TIndexFile claims it's getting dereferenced too many times.  This is
 an old bug; all the TBTree and TBNode classes are pretty dodgy.

 - Assertion failure on "Special Variables" screen in 5Ltest.  This is
 caused by overlong lines.

 Revision 1.9.2.6  2002/04/30 07:57:24  emk
 3.3.2.5 - Port Win32 code to use the 20Kloc of Common code that now
 exists.  The (defstyle ...) command should work, but (textaa ...) isn't
 available yet.

 Next up: Implement the (textaa ...) command and the low-level
 GraphicsTools::Image::DrawBitMap.

 Revision 1.9.2.5  2002/04/29 06:29:58  emk
 3.3.2.4 - Contains first set of performance tweaks, and fixes problem with assertion failures after reload and on CME screens.

 Revision 1.9.2.4  2002/04/26 11:31:01  emk
 3.3.2.3 - Fixed highlight shadow color to default to regular shadow color (instead of highlight color, which is obviously wrong).

 Revision 1.9.2.3  2002/04/26 08:51:21  emk
 3.3.2.2 - First experimental engine with (textaa ...) and (defstyle ...) commands.

 Changes:

   - Ported new TEncoding template class to the Mac.

   - Updated TStyleSheet to provide bug-for-bug compatibility with the way backslashed escaped sequences are processed.

 Revision 1.9.2.2  2002/04/23 11:29:47  emk
 Prepended "VERSION_" to the version-related preprocessor defines, because this way is (1) nicer and (2) matches the Mac engine's preprocessor defines.

 Revision 1.9.2.1  2002/04/19 11:20:13  emk
 Start of the heavy typography merging work.  I'm doing this on a branch
 so I don't cause problems for any of the other developers.

 Alpha-blend text colors.

 Merged Mac and Windows versions of several files into the Common directory.
 Not all of these work on Mac and/or Windows yet, but they're getting there.
 Primary sources for the merged code are:

   Win/FiveL/LVersion.h -> Common/TVersion.h
   Win/FiveL/LStream.h -> Common/TStream.h
   Mac/Source/CStream.cp -> Common/TStream.cpp
   Mac/Source/CStreamTests.cp -> Common/TStreamTests.cpp

 TStream changes:

   * The TStream code now uses a callback to variable values.  This will
     probably go away once Variable and CVariable get merged.
   * Input operators for std::string and GraphicTools::Color.

 Isolated Windows-specific code in TLogger.*, in preparation for a big merge.

   * Added a portable function to set up logging.
   * Fixed the logging code to use the portable FileSystem library.
   * Made FatalError actually quit the application.

 Turned off the FiveL namespace on FIVEL_PLATFORM_OTHER, so we can debug
 with GDB, which has a few minor but painful namespace issues.

 TString changes:

   * Made sure we can convert from std::string to a TString.
   * Added some more assertions.
   * Fixed bug in various operator= methods which would allow the string's
     internal data pointer to be NULL.
   * Changed operator[] and operator() arguments to be 'int' instead of
     'int32' to avoid nasty compiler warnings.

 Typography::Style changes:

   * Added a "ShadowOffset" field that specifies the offset of the
     drop shadow.
   * Added an operator== for testing.
   * Added a ToggleFaceStyle method for toggling specified face style bits.

 Typography::StyledText changes:

   * Added a method to append a single character.

 Other Typography changes:

   * Made FaceStyle an int, not an enum, so we can do bit math with it.
   * Added assertions to made sure you can't extract a StyledText iterator
     until you've called EndConstruction.

 Revision 1.9  2002/04/19 10:21:52  hyjin
 Added support for a movie controller in 5L applications, and deleted some buggy pre-roll code that appeared to be causing crashes.  We're not a hundred percent sure all the crashing problems are fixed, but things seem to be working very well.  Please test this extensively!

 Set global variable _bShowMC to see the movie controller (case insensitive).

 Changes by Yijin, reviewed by Eric Kidd.

 Revision 1.8  2002/04/19 06:02:57  emk
 Merged in MD5-replacement changes from 3.2.0.4.

 This code will become 3.3.1.  PLEASE USE THIS VERSION IN PREFERENCE TO THE 3.3.0
 OR OLDER BINARIES, WHICH THE FSF's LEGAL COUNCIL HAS ASKED US NOT TO SHIP.

 Revision 1.7  2002/03/29 11:14:42  emk
 Final Win32 fixes for 3.3.0 development release.

 Revision 1.6  2002/02/27 13:21:12  tvw
 Bug #613 - Changed calculation of _INCR_Y to include descenders
 (part or letter that goes below baseline).

 Revision 1.5  2002/02/19 12:35:12  tvw
 Bugs #494 and #495 are addressed in this update.

 (1) 5L.prefs configuration file introduced
 (2) 5L_d.exe will no longer be part of CVS codebase, 5L.prefs allows for
     running in different modes.
 (3) Dozens of compile-time switches were removed in favor of
     having a single executable and parameters in the 5L.prefs file.
 (4) CryptStream was updated to support encrypting/decrypting any file.
 (5) Clear file streaming is no longer supported by CryptStream

 For more details, refer to ReleaseNotes.txt

 Revision 1.4  2002/02/19 11:41:38  tvw
 Merged from branch FiveL_3_1_1_Stabilization

 Revision 1.3.2.1  2002/02/19 10:20:23  tvw
 Stable build v3.2.0 (based on v3.1.1)

 Revision 1.3  2002/01/24 19:22:41  tvw
 Fixed bug (#531) in -D command-line option causing
 system registry read error.

 Revision 1.2  2002/01/23 20:39:20  tvw
 A group of changes to support a new stable build.

 (1) Only a single instance of the FiveL executable may run.

 (2) New command-line option "-D" used to lookup the installation directory in the system registry.
     Note: Underscores will be parsed as spaces(" ").
     Ex: FiveL -D HIV_Prevention_Counseling

 (3) Slow down the flash on buttpcx so it can be seen on
     fast machines.  A 200 mS pause was added.

 (4) Several bugfixes to prevent possible crashes when error
     conditions occur.
