  Make phantom nodes classes & running nodes instances
/   Rename MAYBE-ENABLE-EXPENSIVE-EVENTS-FOR-CARD
/   Split hash table used by FIND-NODE into running/non-running versions
    Create nodes when they're run, destroy when they're done
/     ATTR on metaclasses won't default correctly
/     Fix root node & callers
/       NODE-FULL-NAME FIND-NODE-RELATIVE ANALYZE-NODE-NAME
/       ENTER-NODE-RECURSIVELY EXIT-NODE-RECURSIVELY
/     Correctly instantiate root node
/     Fix DEFINE-NODE
/       Becomes much like DEFINE-TEMPLATE
/       INIT-FN can be removed from class and left only in metaclass
/     Update CREATE as needed
/       Need to deal with BINDINGS-EVAL-FN
/     Nuke STATE junk as much as we can
X       Nuke everything related to ACTIVE? - Not yet.
/       The running assertions can all come out
/     Update ENTER-NODE and EXIT-NODE
/       Call sites allocate and deallocate instances
/     Fix BINDINGS junk in CREATE, again (back out diffs with svn?)
/     Get it to compile
      Check it in
      Sort out hygiene problems in DEFINE-NODE
      Clean up MAKE-NODE-TYPE-PREDICATE
      Do we really need separate %ROOT-NODE% class?  Probably.

    STATIC-NODE or NODE-CLASS?
      Make names distinct globally
    Clean up .SEND API

    Replace ASSERT with %ASSERT as needed 

  Port PROP code to run on top of ATTR
    Rip our <node-prop-decl> and replace with attr/attr-default calls
  Port event APIs to new object system
  Move ruby-object tests from experiments.ss to somewhere more useful
  Refactor as much as possible in nodes.ss to be simpler
  Take care of TODO items

  Performance
    Major performance regression on features/mask/light in tamale_test
    Moderate performance regression on features/animation

  Better version of .SEND/APPLY for object methods?

  Get test cases for SET! SLOT from ruby-nodes.ss
  Why did we go into an infinite loop when accessing .RUNNING before it was
    initialized?
  Browser demo card dies on URLs or page titles containing unquoted & or <
  Why START, and not just INDEX?
