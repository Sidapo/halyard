/ Make phantom nodes classes & running nodes instances
/   Replace PROP implementation with regular object properties

/   Create nodes when they're run, destroy when they're done
/     Sort out hygiene problems in DEFINE-NODE
/     Clean up MAKE-NODE-TYPE-PREDICATE
/     Do we really need separate %ROOT-NODE% class?  Probably.

  STATIC-NODE or NODE-CLASS?
    Make names distinct globally
  Clean up .SEND API
  Replace ASSERT with %ASSERT as needed 

/ Port PROP code to run on top of ATTR
/   Rip our <node-prop-decl> and replace with attr/attr-default calls
  Better error message if we call SUPER with no SUPER
  Port event APIs to new object system
  Move ruby-object tests from experiments.ss to somewhere more useful
  Refactor as much as possible in nodes.ss to be simpler
  Take care of TODO items

  Performance
    Major performance regression on features/mask/light in tamale_test
    Moderate performance regression on features/animation

  Better version of .SEND/APPLY for object methods?

  Get test cases for SET! SLOT from ruby-nodes.ss
  Why did we go into an infinite loop when accessing .RUNNING before it was
    initialized?
  Browser demo card dies on URLs or page titles containing unquoted & or <
  Why START, and not just INDEX?
