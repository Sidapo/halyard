  Refactor as much as possible in nodes.ss to be simpler
  Take care of TODO items

  Performance
    Major performance regression on features/mask/light in tamale_test
    Moderate performance regression on features/animation

  Better version of .SEND/APPLY for object methods?

  Get test cases for SET! SLOT from ruby-nodes.ss
  Why did we go into an infinite loop when accessing .RUNNING before it was
    initialized?
