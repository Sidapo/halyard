  ;;
  ;;   rect-offset -> offset-rect
  ;;   point-offset -> offset-point
  ;;   point-in-rect? -> point-in-shape?
  ;;   point-in-poly? -> point-in-shape?
  ;;   offset-shape -> offset-by-point
  ;;   %simple-zone% -> %clickable-zone%
  ;;   zone -> clickable-zone  [* see below]
  ;;   clear-screen -> clear-dc
  ;;   current-card-name -> (node-full-name (current-card))
  ;;   %edit-box-element% -> %edit-box%
  ;;   %sine-wave-element% -> %sine-wave%
  ;;   %movie-element% -> %movie%
  ;;   make-path-from-abstract -> abstract-path->native-path
  ;;   ensure-dir-exists -> ensure-directory-exists
  ;;   measure-picture -> measure-graphic
  ;;   draw-box -> draw-rectangle
  ;;   draw-box-outline -> draw-rectangle-outline
  ;;
  ;; The following functions used to take an element name as their first
  ;; argument.  This has been replaced by an optional keyword parameter
  ;; :NAME.
  ;;
  ;;   clickable-zone browser edit-box geiger-audio
  ;;   sine-wave vorbis-audio movie
  ;;
  ;; The following functions have had parameter changes:
  ;;
  ;;   geiger-synth                  (&rest parameter now regular parameter)
  ;;   draw-picture -> draw-graphic  (point is now first)
  ;;   draw-text                     (rect is now first)
  ;;
  ;; The following templates used to take a :LOCATION parameter.  This has
  ;; been replaced in each case with a :PATH parameter:
  ;;
  ;;   %flash-card% %browser% %geiger-audio% %movie%
  ;;
  ;; The %ZONE% template has been replaced by a %CUSTOM-ELEMENT% template
  ;; and a %BOX% template.  Note that :OVERLAY? defaults to #t for
  ;; %CUSTOM-ELEMENT%, not the old value of #f.
  ;;
  ;; The following functions have been replaced with ON handlers, and may
  ;; be accessed using SEND.  In most cases, this means that element
  ;; references of the form 'FOO are no longer supported; use @FOO instead.
  ;;
  ;;   activex-prop -> activex-prop
  ;;   set-activex-prop! -> set-activex-prop!
  ;;   movie-pause -> pause
  ;;   movie-resume -> resume
  ;;   set-media-volume! -> set-volume!
  ;;   set-geiger-audio-counts-per-second! -> set-counts-per-second!
  ;;
  ;; The following functions still exist, but no longer allow elements to
  ;; be specified by symbols (unless ENABLE-DEPRECATED-FEATURES! has been
  ;; called):
  ;;
  ;;   delete-element delete-elements wait
  ;;
  ;; This also means that you can no longer wait on non-existant elements.
  ;;
  ;; Files which are no longer included in the standard API, but which
  ;; are still available:
  ;;
  ;;   layout.ss
  ;;
  ;; Calling MEASURE-TEXT invalidates your *text-x* and *text-y* values.
  ;; Wrap it in (WITH-SAVED-TEXT-POSITION ...) to preserve the old behavior.
  ;;
  ;; CALL-AT-SAFE-TIME has been replaced by RUN-DEFERRED, which has subtly
  ;; different semantics (see the docs).  This change also affects
  ;; DEFERRED-CALLBACK, of course.
  ;;
  ;; All templates with their own DC must be converted to use ON DRAW
  ;; instead of a bare WITH-DC call.  This can be easy or hard, depending
  ;; on circumstances.  This also means that WITH-DC can be removed from
  ;; DRAW-BUTTON handlers.
  ;;
  ;; Scheme is now case-sensitive.  This affects anyone still using
  ;; uppercase identifiers.  We should probably convert everything to
  ;; lowercase.  In particular, it is now forbbidden for nodes to have
  ;; uppercase characters in their names.
  ;;
  ;; Strings are now Unicode. This shouldn't make much of a difference
  ;; for most people, but if you want to use them as an array of
  ;; bytes, you'll have to start using byte-strings. See the PLT
  ;; manual for details.
  ;;
  ;; Because paths are not Unicode, but instead a platform-defined
  ;; encoding, paths are no longer strings. This means BUILD-PATH now
  ;; returns a path abstract data type instead of a string, and it
  ;; can't be used in place of a string. Almost all functions that
  ;; take a path also take a string, so using strings should still
  ;; work in most cases. See the PLT manual for further details.
  ;; 
  ;; For referring to graphics, media, and so on, we're using our own
  ;; abstract paths, which could refer to either local or http based
  ;; media, which is represented by a string separated with forward
  ;; slashes ("/"). This means that you shouldn't use BUILD-PATH to
  ;; construct arguments for Tamale primitives; instead, just use CAT
  ;; to construct a slash-separated string.
  ;;
  ;; * New node system
  ;;
  ;; @* now takes a string as argument, not a symbol.  Similarly, the FIND-NODE
  ;; API has changed (not that anybody should be using it).
  ;;
  ;; @ and @* now return proxies, not real nodes.  If you encounter
  ;; performance issues calling methods on proxies, you can turn a proxy
  ;; into a node using RESOLVE.  Also note that these functions now
  ;; distinguish between static and running nodes--"static" nodes
  ;; correspond to the old, non-running phantom nodes, and "running" nodes
  ;; include the current card, its parents, and any running elements.
  ;;
  ;; Similarly, ROOT-NODE has now been split into STATIC-ROOT-NODE and
  ;; RUNNING-ROOT-NODE.  These both return real nodes, not proxies.
  ;;
  ;; The node class hierarchy has been ported from Swindle to the new
  ;; object system, and some of the inheritence details have changed.  This
  ;; means that generic functions can no longer dispatch on node types, and
  ;; that typecheck-style code may need to be updated.
  ;;
  ;; As a result, <group> and <sequence> have been renamed to %card-group% and 
  ;; %card-sequence%, respectively.  The old GROUP and SEQUENCE macros are
  ;; now equivalent, and the distinction between groups and sequences is now
  ;; a matter of inheritance.
  ;;
  ;; Removed now useless NODE-CHILDREN from API.  Use .ELEMENTS or .MEMBERS
  ;; instead.
  ;;
  ;; Instead of writing (prop @foo title), new code should ideally write
  ;; (@foo .title).  This also works with SET!.
  ;;
  ;; The :TYPE of template properties is now enforced.
  ;;
  ;; Top-level ON handlers must now be wrapped with the form (WITH-INSTANCE
  ;; (RUNNING-ROOT-NODE) ...).
