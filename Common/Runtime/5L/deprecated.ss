  ;; The following functions have been replaced with ON handlers, and may

  ;; be specified by symbols (unless ENABLE-DEPRECATED-FEATURES! has been

  ;;
  ;;   delete-element delete-elements wait
  ;;
  ;; This also means that you can no longer wait on non-existant elements.
  ;;
  ;; Files which are no longer included in the standard API, but which
  ;; are still available:
  ;;
  ;;   layout.ss
  ;;
  ;; Calling MEASURE-TEXT invalidates your *text-x* and *text-y* values.
  ;; Wrap it in (WITH-SAVED-TEXT-POSITION ...) to preserve the old behavior.
  ;;
  ;; CALL-AT-SAFE-TIME has been replaced by RUN-DEFERRED, which has subtly
  ;; different semantics (see the docs).  This change also affects
  ;; DEFERRED-CALLBACK, of course.
