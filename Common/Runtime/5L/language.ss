;;  Nice LISP Features Typically Missing From Scheme
;;========================================================================
;;  Scheme is a simplified, cleaned-up LISP dialect.  This is both good
;;  and bad--Common LISP contained a lot of unnecessary cruft, but it also
;;  contained some very useful features.
;;
;;  This used to be a nice, lighweight file implementing Common LISP-like
;;  features for Scheme, inspired by Eli's excellent Swindle modules.
;;  However, Eli's modules have finally been updated for use with PLT 2xx,
;;  so this file has been gutted.  See lispish-orig.ss for the original
;;  goodies.
