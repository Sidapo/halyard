  ;;              to run.  The default.
  ;;    STOPPING: The kernel is about to stop.  We use a two-phase stop
  ;;              system--STOPPING indicates we should escape to the
  ;;              top-level loop, and STOPPED indicates that we should
  ;;              efficiently busy-wait at the top-level.
  ;;    STOPPED:  The kernel has been stopped.
  ;;    PAUSED:   The interpreter should pause the current card until it is
  ;;              told to wake back up.  This is used for modal text
  ;;              entry fields, (wait ...), and similar things.
  ;;    JUMPING:  The interpreter should execute a jump.
  ;;    NAPPING:  The interpreter should pause the current card for the
  ;;              specified number of milliseconds.
  ;;    CARD-KILLED: The interpreter should stop executing the current
  ;;               card, and return to the top-level loop.
