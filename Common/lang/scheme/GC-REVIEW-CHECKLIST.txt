The new PLT 3m garbage collector has a very strict and tricky interface.
And getting even a single detail wrong will lead to very nasty bugs:
Intermittent memory corruption at unpredictable times, for example.

To minimize those risks, we have designed a C++ API and a code review
policy for using it.

Please begin by reading the section of "Inside PLT MzScheme" titled
"Cooperating with 3m".

== Review our toolset ==

Check the classes TSchemePtr, TSchemeReg and TSchemeArgs to make sure that
this review policy and those three classes, together, implement a policy
consistent with that described in "Inside PLT MzScheme".

== Storing pointers to Scheme objects in the C++ heap ==

Heap-based pointers to Scheme objects should always be stored in a
TSchemePtr<T> of the appropriate type.  This class uses immobile boxes, and
does all the registration and unregistration for us.

== Storing pointers to Scheme objects on the stack ==

Before continuing, please read the documentation for TSchemeReg and
TSchemeArgs.

Checklist for an ordinary function:

  1. Are all local pointers to the Scheme heap declared at the top of the
     function (or nested block)?  These pointers don't _need_ to be
     manually initialized to NULL, but we do it anyway to prevent g++ for
     issuing warnings.
  2. Is there a TSchemeReg block?
    a. Are the numeric arguments passed to TSchemeReg correct?  The first
       is the number of ordinary pointers we'll be declaring, and the
       second is the number of arrays.  (These will be checked at runtime,
       too, but it's good to review them now.)
    b. Is every parameter registered using 'reg.param'?
    c. Is every local variable registered using 'reg.local'?
    d. Is any TSchemeArgs object registered using 'reg.args'?
    e. Do we call 'reg.done' at the bottom of the block?
  3. Is the code below the TSchemeReg safe?
    a. The code should declare no pointers into the Scheme heap.
    b. The code should contain no places where we nest two expressions that
       manipulate Scheme pointers, or call two different functions that
       return Scheme pointers in the same statement.  All such occurrences
       should have the offending Scheme expressions "lifted" and assigned
       to local variables.
    c. Are all local argument arrays built using TSchemeArgs?  Does the
       number of arguments assigned match the number declared?
    d. Are all spots with something clever going on marked with "MANUAL GC
       PROOF REQUIRED"?
    e. Are the arguments described at each "MANUAL GC PROOF REQUIRED" correct?

Note that CHECK_TVALUE_CONV and CHECK_SCHEME_CONV do a certain amount of GC
registration for their calls in the name of sanity.  Please read the
definitions of these two macros and review their call sites accordingly.

=== Some special cases to watch out for ===

SCHEME_SYM_VAL(...) returns an interior pointer into the middle of the
symbol's memory block.  This interior pointer can be invalidated by the GC.
If you want to access the symbol's value, you can either immediately copy
it to a std::string, or you can use scheme_make_sized_offset_utf8_string,
as seen in TInterpreter::CallPrim.

SCHEME_BYTE_STR_VAL(...) and the other, similar accessor functions appear
to return a regular heap pointer.  These issues are documented in a small
note at the bottom of Section 3.1 in "Inside PLT MzScheme":
