Next commit:
/ Fix ProgramTree
/ Fix group-add-member!
/ Double-check external-nodes.ss
/ Move some APIs back into nodes.ss, especially the (un)registration stuff
/ Doc: We're faking a class with an instance

Cleanup:
/ Stop special-casing "/" in ProgramTree: Add a NodeItemData for it
/ Trampoline vs placeholder terminology?

And then:
/ (find-static-node "/placeholder/child") should work
/ Don't use .member to ensure loads--try something more descriptive
/ GUI for triggering demand-loading from program tree
/ Deal with external-group/card declaration mismatches
/ Give error when attempting to attach children to trampoline
/ Display load info in progress bar
/ Fix jumping to unloaded card during WAIT
/ Rename "demand loading" to "lazy loading"
  Don't save *.ss file counts when lazy-loading enabled
  Better API for activating lazy loading from listener
  Look at new TODOs in 6ba01a4a5508fad202132ce4d4933b552fb3cfed
  Fix [+] controls on Windows

Wrapup:
  Deal with syntax errors during lazy load somehow?  (For now, reload)
  GUI for controlling lazy loading mode
  Never lazy load when in runtime mode

Nice to have:
  Give all nodes and node proxies a "resolve" method
  Deal with *node-defined-hook* and Robinson's metadata library?
  Smart static node paths
