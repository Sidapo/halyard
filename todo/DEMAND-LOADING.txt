Next commit:
/ Fix ProgramTree
/ Fix group-add-member!
/ Double-check external-nodes.ss
/ Move some APIs back into nodes.ss, especially the (un)registration stuff
/ Doc: We're faking a class with an instance

Cleanup:
  Stop special-casing "/" in ProgramTree: Add a NodeItemData for it
  Trampoline vs placeholder terminology?

Older:
  GUI for triggering demand-loading from program tree
  GUI for controlling demand-loading mode
  Never demand-load when in runtime mode
  (find-static-node "/placeholder/child") should work

Nice to have:
  Smart static node paths
