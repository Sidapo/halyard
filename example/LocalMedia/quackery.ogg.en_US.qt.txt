I'm Raymond Massey and I have

[00:00:02.91]
a special message for senior citizens.

[00:00:05.34]
Today's doctors, drugs, and medical devices

[00:00:08.68]
truly work medical miracles for young and old alike

[00:00:12.22]
but there are some as phony as a 3 dollar  bill.

[00:00:15.66]
Like this zeta applicator for example

[00:00:18.46]
which  is claimed to cure arthritis with Z-Rays.

[00:00:21.84]
There are no Z-Rays.

[00:00:24.58]
This fake device claimed to cure cancer

[00:00:26.94]
with tape recorded music.

[00:00:29.54]
(music plays)

[00:00:31.02]
The practitioner who used it

[00:00:32.45]
was as big a phony as his device.

[00:00:35.28]
A doorbell doctor sold this food supplement

[00:00:37.92]
to treat 42 diseases. It has nothing of value

[00:00:41.06]
that's not contained  in the food

[00:00:42.59]
you buy in the supermarket.

[00:00:44.88]
Investigate before you invest

[00:00:46.56]
in health services or products.

[00:00:48.64]
Help stamp out quackery.

[00:00:50.55]

[00:00:50.93]
